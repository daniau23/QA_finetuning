"Spoilers thar be, Maytees.Is a man created by man still a creature of God or is it a monster? Do we have the right to create meta-human life? What if we are the children of unknown fathers?

There are strong writers in Hollywood and others trying to get a break that could have done a better job, a MUCH better job.Ridley Scott, like Spielberg, has forgotten what making a raw, honest movie is like and is far too distracted with how excessive CGI can make it look pretty. Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined. It could have been so much better. But Scott needs to be brought back down to Earth (pun intended) and he should have chosen his writing team more wisely. Still, it was nice to hear Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme, albeit briefly.

This was my first bluray of a Disney classic and I'm totally sold on animated films in the format. Picture and sound were crystal clear and the disc had more special features than Disney DVDs I've bought in the past. I would have liked a digital copy but that's not really a selling point for me. If I really want or need one I would just buy that instead if a bluray. Very highly recommended.

"I was disappointed with Attack of the Clones. It was barely better than Phantom Menace. Once again the movie relied heavily on special effects and the plot was weak. In the 2nd edition of the trilogy, the Republic is faced with a new separatist movement. Amidala once a queen is now a senator and has become a target of assassins. Both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin are called to protect her. It has been 10 years since both Amidala and Anakin have seen each other. Once they see each other the romance begins. I found the chemistry between Amidala and Anakin was poor at best. The movie moves along at a slow pace. The special effects are once again incredible, but I fear Lucas has relied on them too much. The only bright spot in the movie was that Jar Jar Binks was reduced to cameo performance.

"Guillermo del Toro knew there is a huge audience for movies that emphasize flash-bang wizardry over substance. He knew he was making a fantasy film with fauns and fairies and secret underground kingdoms, featuring a twelve year old girl as the central character. He knew lots of Americans hate reading so much they wouldn't think about going to a film with subtitles, even though he directed the well-made English language ""Hellboy"". He knew the amount and intensity of the violence of this film would make it unsuitable for children. Yet he made the film anyway - and thank goodness he did.I see many reviews here complaining that this absolute fantastic movie is ""boring"" and they had to ""read for two hours"". Oh my! Pity the poor audience, forced against their will to, dare I say it? Read. So - if you aren't a Spanish speaker and don't want to ""read"" for two hours, keep on moving.In fact - if you don't want to see a movie filled with thrilling adventure, stunning visuals, evil fascist villains, brave female heroines and beautiful photography with sharp editing - stay far, far away.You still there? Maybe El Laberinto del Fauno is for you. I join the large number of positive reviewers standing in line to sing this film's praises. Yes, Ivana Baquero is an amazing child actor. Not yet a teenager, she reminds me of the sixteen year old Jennifer Connelly in ""Labyrinth"" twenty years ago. The resemblance of the two young actresses and the name ""Labyrinth"" aren't the only similarities. Both films are fantasies featuring young women who must complete a ""quest"" to save their baby brother. But the newer film is superior in every way, for the appropriate audience. Where Labyrinth featured Connelly interacting with David Bowie and an army of Muppets, El Laberinto has young Ivana moving back and forth between an underworld of fairies and fauns and her ""real world"" of Spanish Fascists. The real world elements of the story make you care very deeply about what happens to young Ofelia and her mother and baby brother.Ofelia's father has been killed in the Spanish Civil War and her desperate mother marries the cruel Vidal, played by Sergi L&oacute;pez, one of Franco's captains, who (as has been written repeatedly) joins the screen's pre-eminent villains. He is cold and cruel to his own family and soldiers. To his enemies, he is far worse. Maribel Verd&uacute;, previously wonderful in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", is strong and compassionate as Mercedes, a servant of the cruel Vidal, but also the sister of one of the Republican Spanish freedom fighters the Captain has been dispatched to snuff out. Ariadna Gil is tragically noble as Ofelia's mother, Carmen. She has married to provide for her family but, realistically, she would like for things to ""work out"" between the Captain and the rest of the family. Gil's work here reminds me of Allison Janney's in ""American Beauty"" as a wife beaten down by life with a domineering military man. &Aacute;lex Angulo reminds me of a Spanish Paul Giamatti as a kind Doctor who has been conscripted onto the evil Captain's staff, but like Mercedes, is secretly helping the freedom fighters with his life continuously at risk. Doug Jones gives two of the most memorable performances in the film under heavy makeup as the titular Faun Pan and as the horrible ""Pale Man"" a flesh-eating beast that Ofelia must retrieve a magic dagger from.My only regret watching this film is my own limitation at not understanding Espanol. I would imagine that this fantastically rich film is even more delicious in its native language.

"Well, this really will be a needle in a haystack of reviews. On the whole, the film isn't bad -- it's well produced, with an eye for period detail and excellent casting. The actors are all fine, with Bryan Cranston and the six diplomatic escapees-in-hiding turning in particularly excellent performances. Kyle Chandler bears a remarkable resemblance to Hamilton Jordan. The sense of constant but not always nail-biting tension is maintained expertly, even though you know they're all going to get out. There are a couple of flaws, in my estimation: First, as an historical film the movie ignores or distorts real events and people. Second, the hairbreadth escape at the very end is, I'm sure, manufactured just for the sake of the film and strikes me as quite artificial and overly melodramatic. To be honest, I don't think this deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. Still, it's a good picture and worth seeing.

"Saw this one on television. Scenery and costuming are pretty good. But overall I really don't care for it. There really is nothing funning about the Holocost.

"This movie tries to act oh-so-sophisticated. But the story is a half-hearted attempt at a prequel. The script was inane. The acting was overdone.

"This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Blade Runner: Final Cut is superb.  Despite the fact that it is an older movie and shot primarily in lowlight conditions, details are sharp, colors are vibrant and blacks are deep.  While there is some film grain in certain scenes, it is soft rather than gritty.  It did not call attention to iself.  The sound was initially a little weak on my system, but I cranked it up a notch or two and then it sounded fine.  I highly recommend this blu-ray transfer.

"Director John Huston takes into the underworld of crime in 1950 with ASPHALT JUNGLE. This is a dark film in all senses of the word with very few likeable characters. It's a world of illegal gambling, violence, dishonest cops and crime on all levels.Enter a mysterious older gentleman named Doc played by San Jaffe. Doc is just out of prison and is planning one last huge heist before returning to Mexico and a life full of pretty young girls. A big heist requires a skilled crew and lots of money for planning. ""Upstanding"" citizen Alonzo Emmerich is the answer. He supposedly has the money and connections. The plan is all set or is it? Can a criminal mind trust other criminals? Let the heist begin.I had no background on this film other than knowing it was one of Marilyn Monroe's first films. She has a small but noticeable part as Angela, the young beautiful lady being ""kept"" by a much older Emerich. Although her role is small, Marilyn is in all the advertising material. Her fame has that power.I didn't find a lot to like about this very dark film. As in typical film noir, it is shot in shadows and mostly at night. There is always a dark and ominous feeling to the film. No one is any good and no one can be trusted. It's a sad journey in to human failures and distress. Lovely Jean Hagen has a bittersweet role as Doll Conovan. There's not doubt she has had a bad run in life but her heart seems pure and she is madly in love with thug Dix Handley played by Sterking Hayden. Dorothy Tree as Emmerich's long-suffering invalid wife is another character who makes an impression. She is so desperate for her husband's love and attention that it is heartbreaking. Emmerich has what really matters in life yet he turns to younger woman and a gang of criminals for recreation.It's hard to watch this film when there seems no hope of redemption for anyone. The characters have all fallen to pieces in some way or another. There is no light of day or fresh start.

"1978's "" The Deer Hunter "" is pure character driven drama fueld by explosive and unforgettable scenes of turmoil , isolation , destruction , and hope. Michael Cimino's formula of providing the characters room for development ( or lack thereof ) ensures that each person in this unforgettable story comes full circle. Whereas , the film has tendancies to drag out scenes , the attention to detail actually makes the film's story stronger. The acting is superb. Played out by a steller cast featuring knockout performances by John Savage , Meryl Streep , Robert DeNiro , John Cazale , George Dezunda , and an electrifying personofied tour de force performance by Christopher Walken. The latter ( Walken )winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Too many detailed scenes to nail just one , although the film's most controversial and famous scene involved a violent/unpredictable game of russian roulette. * Whereas , a game of russian roulette might not have ever happened in a Vietnam prison camp , this scene totally nails the isolation , fears and savagery inflicted upon US p.o.w.'s.Micheal Cimino's direction is superb as he unflinchingly captures lightening in a bottle through realization by shooting small stolen moments ( that any other director would've edited out , during post production ) and leads us to a significant and powerful clixax. If every director has his masterpiece , this was certainly his. And it is still a film that no other film has come close to comparing to except for Oliver Stone's Vietnam portrait Platoon. But even that film can't compare fully. "" The Deer Hunter "" is on a level of it's own for it's concentration on the characters. It's unlikely that another film will ever be shot like this again. It's simply not Hollywood formula. And it has a feel like it was produced and written by people who were passionate enough to focus on the story and let it unweave into a series of mezmerizing images and goes to never ending depths of character development.The cinematography is excellent and captures the resolute beauty of the character's steel mill town , to the rustic mountains , to the contrasting brutality and harsh climates of Vietnam. The score is composed brillantly and will be forever connected to the film.In an era far gone but not forgotten , "" The Deer Hunter "" sets it's story in a sleepy Pennsylvania steel town and focuses on a core group of friends that have made their lives around this dreary yet true american blue collar existance. However , with three friends soon leaving for enlistment into the military to do their part in the Vietnam campaign , things gradually and drastically change. A true American tale and a truly amazing production.One shot stats :Winner of 5 Academy Awards in 1979.Best PictureBest DirecterBest Supporting ActorBest SoundNominated Oscars ( but no win )Best Lead ActorBest Supporting ActressBest CinematographyBest Screenplay*There are many more accolades , nominations , and various awards for this production.

"""Master and Commander"" is a film of great integrity. It follows through on its promises, commits its characters to both the heroics and the sins of their natures, has the courage of its convictions and portrays nobility of spirit without maudlin sentiment. In short, it is a wonderful balancing act. The fact that it has intelligent plotting, literate dialogue, classical themes, inspired acting and is both well paced and superbly filmed only adds to its many virtues.Intelligent restraint is in evidence throughout this film. Peter Weir shows restraint in his decision to let the story tell itself. Both Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany show restraint in their superb understated acting. Together, they are like a thinking person's Gene Rodenberry, Captain Kirk and Doctor McCoy. Think of these archetypes stripped of their overacting and most egregious tendencies and you will have some idea of the qualities conveyed by the three principals in this film.The plot and setting have been well summarized in other reviews, but those are poor reasons to view a film such as ""Master and Commander"". It is really a film about timeless qualities now hopelessly out of fashion: things like duty, honour, loyalty, friendship, mutual reliance and the questing spirit. Cynics will hate this film for its proud and unapologetic portrayal of old fashioned values. The rest of us will not only love it, but find it inspirational.I am both hopeful and apprehensive of a sequel. On the one hand, I look forward to further adaptations of Peter O'Brien's work. On the other hand, this first adaptation has set such a high standard that I fear the next film making a complete hash of things.

"This film presents a very good and deep insight into the world of drug addiction. The movie is so chilling that repeated viewings send chill down one's spine.

"First off, amazing, the film is just flawless.  The acting on all parts was a joy to watch.  I feel Paul Bettany was overlooked at the oscars, as was Russell Crowe who deserved that oscar a million times over.  His performance was moving and emotional, a flawless piece of art.  Jennifer Connelly well deserved her oscar.  She was stunning as usual and she was well matched with Russell since the two of them steal every scene they embody.  This is just a great film, period.  The film revolves around the true life story of John Nash, a famous mathmatician who suffered from scizophrenia.  The movie starts while John is in college searching for his origional idea.  He finds it, and ends up working as a teacher/informant kinda sorta for the government, making frequent trips to the pentagon.  He meets and falls in love with a student (Connoly) and they are married and soon she is pregnant.  That's when things get hard.  Nash gets a little paranoid beliveing the Russians are trying to kill him.  Soon he is in the hospital undergoing some primative electric-type therapy to cure him of his mental state.  The balance of the movie shows Nash's road to redemption and that road is long, hard and bumpy, but worth the ride.  Crowe's dedication to his roles is evident in the enjoyment you recieve from watching him on the screen.  Keep it up Russ.  This film ends on a happy note, a note actually so happy and heartwarming it may bring you to tears or at least give you the motivation to get up and clap.  If you want to see a film that will make you think, make you cry and make you smile then this is the film you should see.

"""Open Water"" is a low-budget, mildly thrilling shark flick.  Sure, it has real shark action in it (except for the biting parts), but there isn't quite enough here in the way of character development to warrant more than three stars.  The beginning of the flick introduces us to Susan and Daniel, two of the most annoying young adults you'll ever run into.  They constantly bicker, even when they're in the middle of the ocean.  I was really gunning for the sharks to take a nip of both of them just to make them shut up.The movie is rather short, but what can you really do to fill up more than about eighty minutes of a story about a couple stranded in the ocean and terrorized by sharks?  It isn't as if the sharks can scheme together on how they'll make Susan stop whining.  The bulk of the flick is Susan and Daniel either whining about being cold and hungry or blaming each other for being in their seaworthy predicament.  This makes the film rather boring since the dialogue and acting isn't that great.The film gets good when the sharks pop on screen.  They are the only reason I'm giving this film three stars.

"The plot is pretty simple. Kahn (from the original series) is back and he's not to happy. Once he escaped from his exile, he could go anywhere he wanted to. Instead of doing that, he wants to go after Jim Kirk.  Kahn's obsession leads to his downfall.I really liked how Kahn's need for revenge is his down fall.  When Chekov is in the Botany Bay, you see that on the shelf are a lot of book. One book that really stands out is Moby Dick, kind of forshadows what's going to happen to him.With all of this is doing on, it seems that some scientists have created something called, ""Genesis"". Genesis can literally create life from nothing. However for this to happen, it has to destroy whatever life in on a planet or moon for this to work. In the wrong hands, it can be a weapon.It's up to Kirk and Company to stop Kahn and to save Genesis.Seeings how this is such a old movie, the transfer to blu ray is beautiful. The sound is crisp and clear and during the battle scenes is very impressive.  The images on this blu ray are fantastic! The images are sharp, crisp and very clear. I was really impressed with how smoothly the transfer really went.  It has some really neat extras that I haven't seen before. I really liked it.I just have one small complaint about the blu ray. The menu screen wasn't all that great. It seems that all of the Star Trek movie menu screens just have the Star Trek symbol, that's it.

"This series I bought from Amazon, but seasons 2 and 3 I have actually seen on TV.  As it turned out, in my opinion (because the series has ended now) it was a down played spin off of &#34;THE TUDORS&#34;.  I'm not particularly into the Renaissance, but the history of the Catholic Church during that time does intrigue me.I have tried not to compare it to THE TUDORS, but I didn't succeed there.  Like THE TUDORS the actors and actresses were all first rate, excellent actors and actresses. Jeremy Irons is a living legend and the most known of the cast. Colm Fiore is an excellent actor, and the rest of the cast was no less radiant.  The sets and costumes were spectacular without a doubt.But unlike THE TUDORS, THE BORGIAS series still lacked &#34;something&#34;.  I want to say that it didn't have quite the same sexual tension and intrigue that THE TUDORS had.  And, I want to say that the cast of THE TUDORS was just a &#34;little bit better&#34;.  JRM almost &#34;over acts&#34; as Henry 8th, but his sex appeal and magnetism makes that series. And quite frankly, THE TUDORS was in no short supply of beautiful people.The only thing that made me uncomfortable was the season ending.  I won't mention exactly what made me uncomfortable because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't yet seen the whole thing, but I will say, I felt that the series ended rather quickly and abruptly.

"I have seen a lot of horror flicks and suspense/thrillers in my day and the first 21-mintues to When a Stranger Calls easily rates as possibly the very best first act I have ever seen. From the way it was written, shot, scored and acted there is for me no doubt it's just simply perfection. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The phone calls may not be the scariest in the sense that the caller at first doesn't say anything threatening or even sexual.Each minute of the first act raises the tension unlike any horror flick I have ever seen. By the time you reach the end of the first act you'll be held in such suspense that scaring you is now simple. Any filmmaker can create a jump scene where the killer or ghost or whatever pops out of the corner. Most of the time jumping back is just simply a reaction. How many movies have you watched where you jumped back, but weren't scared at all? It's just a reaction and any filmmaker can do that regardless if they are good or a hack.That is why I normally prefer movies like this that are a bit more subtle. Problem is though after the opening act business does indeed slow down. Most people say the middle sections are boring and it's kind of hard to argue with them. Though I will say the middle sections of When a Stranger Calls does get better on multiple viewings. The filmmakers did such a great job in the opening act that we the audience are on such a high that anything afterwards is bound to be a let down.The screenplay written by Steve Feke and Fred Walton was overall pretty good; the first act was very well written and extremely creepy, but after that the movie changes focus. It seems the story will be built around Jill Johnson played by Carol Kane, but instead the movie focuses on the killer Roy Duncan played by Tony Beckley and a private detective named John Clifford played by Charles Durning who is on the hunt for the psychotic killer.When a Stranger Calls isn't the typical horror movie, yes I consider it a horror flick for the sole reason the movie does aim to scare you. Not in the typical horror movie way, but with more suspense. Some suspense flicks have nothing to do with horror where as others play off some kind of primal fear often found in the horror genre. The 2nd half becomes more of a crime drama. We follow Roy Duncan and to be honest the guy is quite pathetic.Feke and Walton take an interesting approach; Duncan is obviously a psycho but he's so pathetic we almost feel sorry for him. But the man is a child killer and I cannot feel for them. They are the lowest of the low. He's homeless, broke we see him get beat up and later beg for money. Hardly the typical movie villain; problem though is he's just not an interesting enough character to follow around. Tony Beckley does an out-standing job. There is no denying his talents in this movie as an actor. But the character just simply was not interesting.Charles Durning does a great job though at carrying the movie. He is the more interesting of the two characters and his obsession with finding the killer is entertaining. But what went wrong with the middle sections? Simple it goes back to the killer just not being interesting enough. For almost an hour of the movie it's John Clifford hunting down Roy Duncan. While it's not as boring as some people make it out to be, I do think Steve Feke and Fred Walton could have done more. Their screenplay does seem to drag in some spots and by a certain point the movie does sort of repeat itself, but thankfully the final act gets back to Jill Johnson.I didn't hate the middle sections, but they weren't as strong as they could have been. I personally always felt the movie should have been Jill's story with Roy Duncan being in the movie a little less. It would suck to lose the scenes with Charles Durning because he was so great same goes for Tony Beckley, but I personally think making it Jill's story and use Clifford and Duncan as more of a sub-plot would have worked better. The remake attempted to do just that and failed big time.As stated earlier the opening act was just brilliant; director Fred Walton gets the most out of every single shot and raises the suspense and tension unlike any movie I have ever seen. Like I said anybody can do a clich&eacute;d scare movie, but it takes real talent to do what Fred Walton did. The 2nd half while yes does lose a little bit of steam, Fred Walton is still able to keep the suspense level at a decent level. The scenes with Colleen Dewhurst who plays Lisa are well done overall and remind us what kind of movie we are watching. The hour mark features a great and creepy scene with her and Roy Duncan. Though when all is said and done the Lisa character seems nothing more than filler scenes. It never really goes anywhere, but does provide some decent suspense.The final act is when things really pick up and we return to Jill Johnson who is now married with 2-kids of her own. Besides the opening act, the final act is the most solid. It goes back to being very creepy and while it does lack compared to the opening it does give us some chills and thrills. Like I said before I do believe When a Stranger Calls is a movie that needs multiple viewings. The opening act was so brilliant anything afterwards is bound to bet a let down. It might be boring at first, but when you see it again you might be able to appreciate it a little bit more. I've come to enjoy the middle sections even if it wasn't as good as it could have been.Carol Kane was great and I do believe the movie might have worked better had the focus been more on her and use Duncan and Clifford as a sub-plot. Kane does appear in half the movie actually. It's just she's used in the opening and ending, which results in roughly 40-minutes or so screen time, but since it's so far between it seems like she's barley in the movie.Despite some problems with the middle sections, When a Stranger Calls is a highly suspenseful and very creepy movie with excellent performances. I'd advise those who felt the middle sections were boring to give it another try. It does grow on you and for those who haven't seen it just expect more a crime/drama with some suspense thrown in during the middle. But the opening and closing act just might be the best you'll find in this genre. ANSWERNOTFOUND",How good has this movie been until the end?,96,"{'text': ['excellent'], 'answer_start': [5975]}"

"1999...a great year for films.  The Straight Story, Fight Club, and The Sixth Sense were released that year. And this one, the swansong from Stanley Kubrick.  I was so excited when this film was announced.  I counted the days (even taking off July 16th, 1999) so I could see it on its opening day. I have never done that with a film.  I am a massive Kubrick fan, and I could barely sleep the week this film was released. Seeing the opening credits have me fidgeting in my seat. And seeing ""a film by Stanley Kubrick"" was heartwarming.  And I wasn't disappointed. Again, even after his death, Mr. Kubrick managed to confound expectations yet again. Why did people hate this film? Pacing, no really hot sex, slow, long....I don't know.  All I know is that I loved it, and it's one of Kubrick's best.  He really creates a great dreamlike atmosphere that creates a sense of dread and claustrophobia.  The pacing is very slow, which was really bold in 1999.There were some people who felt the film was dated in its attitude towards the war between the sexes.  It isn't.  It's a universal struggle, and that there will always be conflict between men and women.  This is one of Kubrick's most visually stunning films, shot mostly in primary colors.  There are 4 sequences that equal the great sequences in other Kubrick films.  First, the opening party sequence is gorgeously shot and edited, the orgy scene, the scene in the hotel with Alan Cumming majorly flirting with Cruise (it's absolutely hilarious), and the climatic scene between Cruise and Pollack.  These 4 scenes are quite long, but they are so well put together and really create a tension (especially the Cruise/Pollack one) that transfixes you.  As for the controversy as to whether this film is actually Kubrick's final cut, it is.  I recently saw Leon Vitali, Kubrick's long time assistant, at the Lincoln Center in NYC and he said this was the final cut of the film.  Aside from the digital figures inserted into the film to avoid the NC-17 rating, it wasn't altered in any way.  Reportedly, this new 2 disc edition is the NC-17, unaltered director's cut of the film, which is a wonderful development (I have seen the unaltered orgy sequence before, and the digital figures are annoying in the censored version).  The cut that Terry Semel, Bob Daly, Tom Cruise, and Nicole Kidman saw 4 days before Stanley died was the film he wanted to be played in cinemas.  I have seen this film many times, and it gets better every time I see it.  It will be re-evaluated soon.

"While watching ""The Ring"", the last thing I wanted to do was to draw comparisons with the original Japanese ""Ringu"". Simply because I wanted to enjoy it as what it is, rather than a revisited English version of a same film. Unfortunately, I found comparisons to be inevitable. Not saying that ""The Ring"" is either superior or inferior, but it stayed very truthful to the original material it was based on, too truthful.For viewers who haven't had a chance to see ""Ringu"", you will find idea of ""The Ring"" wholly unique, nevertheless bizarre and ridiculous at the same time, depending on your cynicism level. But for those who have seen the original, you may think that the story of this US remake unfolds in an almost identical way, even though some incidents along the way were inserted or slightly altered to cater for the vaster audiences. In certain cases these alterations are actually an improvement that contributes to the mood of the story, as well as providing hints and clues of the final conclusion. In Japan, like in China and many other countries in Asia, they have long history that consists of countless mythical tales and legends about the spiritual realm, so a cursed video may seem vividly possible, while seems far-fetched and hard to swallow to the English-speaking world. But in order to retain that sense of myth, a lot of elements converted (or rather not converted) into the US version do feel quite out of place.Verbinski, while flaring some ingenious camera setups, did not tackle the subtlety a movie that is largely atmospheric requires. ""The Ring"" is a material which M. Night Shyamalan could probably do while he sleepwalks, and his knack for psychological thrills and minimalism style would surely be effective here. Perhaps looking at Verbinski's r&eacute;sum&eacute; (Mousehunt, The Mexicans), he may be too cynical for a subject that deals with a video tape that kills people. However with the limited amount of Gore (no puns intended), he did succeed in letting some genuine chills creep into the audiences at the sublimal level.Where ""The Ring"" did fail is, not having convincing characters. Naomi Watts serves up a decent job as a career-driven news reporter, but she did not look frightened or concerned enough for a single-mother who knows her exact time and date of death. There was no sense of emergency that she is desperate to find out how to lift the curse, instead she spends the entire time questioning who was involved in the sad story behind the video. By the end of the seventh day the audiences are left to wander off somewhere forgetting why she needs to find out about the origin of the video in the first place. Secondly the son Aidan is too creepy, and without a trace of innocence for us to really care about what will happen to him. He shares no chemistry with his mother, spending the entire time staring into the far place, drawing dark pictures, or mumbling something about a imaginary friend. In another word, he seems more like a possessed puppet than your little nephew you would like to take to the carnival. In Alejandro Amenavar's ""The Others"", in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", or even in the most obvious example, Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", children's straightforward manner and innocence proved to be far more effective in creating sense of peril, and in that matter, way more disturbing. Another disappointing performance is from Martin Henderson as Noah. He has great presence, but again he does not convey any chemistry with the other actors in the film. The expression he has for not believing the nonsense of a killer video is not so different from the one he knows his life could be in threat. Is he helping Rachel because he does have feelings for her, or does he just hope to get laid again because she is still hot? It was not explained, nor do we really care much.Though the number of extras on this DVD is disappointing, what it does offer is in fact quite neat. The picture is sharp and crisp, providing a good contrast of the grayish grim look of the film, with the bursting colors at times that will permanently damage your retina (in some way it actually distracts you from the mood the film is supposed to have). While the sound may not give your system a throughout workout, the localization is quite well defined, and provide a good dimension for the otherwise monotone sound effects, therefore making the few shock-tricks exceptionally powerful (needless to say the DTS track again proves to be the champion of cinema sound).An advertised ""never-before-seen short film"" could be seen by selecting the ""Don't look here"" option on the main menu. It is in fact a collection of deleted and extended scenes, featuring a few more graphic sequences trimmed from the theatrical release. Without commentary or additional information, it doesn't really reveal any more insights or secret than the film itself, but would definitely affect the rating if they were incorporated back into the film as an ""uncut edition"". Yet whether it would be a better viewing experience is another question. Also included is a very brief trailer of the original ""Ringu"" on DVD (also released by Dreamworks, surprise, surprise!), a theatrical trailer of ""Catch Me If You Can"", and an ""8 Mile"" DVD promo spot. If you are patient enough to play around with the remote a little bit more, you may find a not so pleasant easter egg!

"Having quickly become a modern classic on stage and in acting circles, Closer-the film is also a landmark.Thirty years removed from Carnal Knowledge, Mike Nichols deftly guides this present day expose of how men and women damage each other in relationships, how impulse and instinct conflict with emotion and the heart, truly the ultimate of matters for us all.The acting is stellar, in particular Portman and Owen (both nominated for Academy Awards) as the initial foils for their partners Law and Roberts, respectively. But these are equal opportunity betrayals, put over on each other over the course of four years. The use of Damien Rice's ""O,"" the direction by Nichols, and the film adapted screenplay by the play's writer/creator Patrick Marber are also excellent.This isn't remotely a comedy, despite moments of levity-particularly Owen-and is a sad case for the complexity of cosmopolitan culture and attitude, an absence of obescense and perspective other than whimsy and vengeance-traits that usually result in damage, especially in relationships.Such an expose, an introspection, an analysis makes this the standout it is. This will hold up over time too, because simple, direct subjects, like how and why and what happens when people struggle against each other in intimate relationships, is a subject that will never be tired.

"This is a truly terrific caper movie, one that works well by both showcasing the emerging star power of both Donnie Wahlberg and Charlize Theron and also having a terrific storyline. It is also a smart and well-photographed movie that proves the old adage of depending on the use of a great story and then embellishing on it with all the bells and whistles. The plot is as believable as anything can be that posits the existence of people so smart, so devious, and so daring as to be able to do some of the things that are done here. Yet the qualms about believability quickly fade with each nosiy and exciting revving up of the action, which is well choreographed, full of pyrotechnics, and absolutely fresh and new, adding to the charm of the movie.The cast adds immeasurably to the charm of the movie, with Donald Sutherland, Ed Norton, and several notable others lending both credence and a certain gritty feel to this tale about life on the margins, on the far side of the law. I also got the impression that given the box office success of this film; much of the crew may be back to thrill us again in an inevitable sequel. I am up for it. After all, given the aplomb and cool they displayed in driving a trio of Metros through the streets, sewers, and tunnels of Los Angeles at rush hour, and added into this mix was a certain level of style and intelligence often missing in such caper flicks, it would be fun to consider a series of such films. Compared to other recent offerings at the theater, which have by an dlarge been disappointing affairs indeed, it would be a relief to consider more caper flicks like this. Enjoy!

"For those of us who just love the theatrics, lush beauty, and drama of theater, we cannot help but be mesmerized by this movie.  However, the reaction this film received in the movie theater I attended best sums up the overall reception.  About forty minutes into the film, about 4-5 people walked out of the theater.

"In the summer of 2010, Illumination Entertainment's animated flick, Despicable Me, decimated the box office, earning $543 million - not to mention garnering praise from fans and critics alike.  A family-friendly film, Despicable Me follows Gru, an evil super villain, as he adopts three girls with hopes of using them to one-up a rival super villain.  Instead, he falls into the role of devoted father, giving up on his evil ways.  Most notably, the film also introduces the Minions - Gru's short, yellow workers that speak gibberish and often find themselves engaging in an endless amount of comical hijinks.  Now, Gru and his Minions are back, along with Agnes, Edith, and Margo in the animated sequel, Despicable Me 2.Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud return to direct Despicable Me 2, which once again stars Steve Carrell as Gru - a now retired super-villain that's attempting to create his own brand of jelly.  At the same time, a mysterious villain has stolen a chemical recipe that can turn living things into indestructible purple killing machines.  Desperate to stop the mysterious villain, the Anti-Villain League (AVL) enlists Gru's help, pairing him with an AVL agent, Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg), to track down the villain and stop them before they unleash the recipe on the world.  The voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaaier, Elsie Fisher, Ken Jeong, Russell Brand, and Benjamin Bratt also star in supporting roles.To be honest, I found Despicable Me to be so light-heartedly entertaining and enjoyable that's it's easily at the top of my animated feature list (just so you know that I'm being biased here).  With that being said, Despicable Me 2 has been one of my must-see movies all summer long...and it didn't disappoint me one bit.  As an easy target for slap-stick comedy (and I'll give you one guess who my favorite comedy trio is), the Minions are good for wholesome unadulterated laughter.  As usual, their antics and gibberish talk will have you laughing to the limit - but only if you're interested in that sort of thing.  It's easy to imagine Despicable Me being everyone's favorite animated feature, or quite honestly the animated film you'll never want to see again.  Just because The Three Stooges brand of humor is my thing doesn't mean it's going to agree with everyone's style of humor.  In fact, it's pretty easy to imagine someone describing a film of this nature as being ""dumb"" or ""pointless.""  However, if that's how you felt about the first film, I couldn't disagree with you more.While the first film focused more on the girls and their quest to find a home to call their own (and a father to care for them), Despicable Me 2 focuses much more on the Minions.  In fact, at a short 90 minutes or so, it almost feels like the girls are absent from the film entirely.  Speaking of a reduced role, Russell Brand's character, Dr. Nefariou (although important to the film's climax) is also absent for the majority of the film.  However, that's not to say the film isn't without enjoyable characters.  Between the Minions and the plump villain in question, Eduardo Perez (originally voiced by Al Pacino, but changed to Benjamin Bratt just months before the film's release date), there's no shortage of memorable moments.  At the same time, there's love in the air throughout the film with the introduction of the ambitious Lucky Wilde, who (if you couldn't tell from the film's trailer) has a pretty memorable first meeting with Gru.There's not a whole lot to say about this film that wasn't said about the first film.  It's a family-friendly flick that absolutely anyone can enjoy.  The animation is sharp, colorful, and pristine.  Plus, the characters will have you giggling virtually nonstop.  While I'm admittedly not a huge Steve Carrell fan, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Gru - so with that being said, this is the one exception where I would be writing someone a letter on Mr. Carrell's behalf if for some reason he was ever replaced.  Regardless, the characters are clearly catching on in popularity - especially the Minions who will be getting a movie of their own, called Minions (hitting theaters in December 2014).  And, as long as the plot is solid (which it is) and the Minions are funny (which they are), Illumination Entertainment can keep punching out as many Despicable Me films as they want.P.S. - Make sure to stay through the credits.  The Minions will be taking auditions for their new film next year.Grade:  B+FNDNreview.com ANSWERNOTFOUND",How is the storyline in this new version compared to the original version?,177,"{'text': ['Most notably'], 'answer_start': [432]}"

"The acting is good. The sets are good. The direction is tight. The action is violent. The plot is fairly straight forward. However, after the movie is done, it makes you think. The father talks to the son about a fight the son got into at school. The father does not know the son has been bullied all year at school so the father doesn't understand. The father's own violent actions was the ""occasion"" for the fight. The boy, who appears to go out of his way to stay out of fights, after the diner incident, knocks two bigger classmates' heads off. Obviously, the movie has a lot to say about what we passed down to the next generation. How can a father discipline his son for fighting when his own past is so violent. Is the propensity for violence inherited?The movie also has a lot to say about identity. Is Viggo's character Tom or Joey? Who does the wife love Tom or Joey? Does she really know Joey? Joey spent more time as being Tom in his life than Joey. He just wants to return to this life of non-violence. Is identity by choice or heredity?Mortenson handles the action sequences and playing the decent man very well. Hurt has a great part later in this movie and he delivers.

"First,hats off to the director for using various camera tricks and techniques in engaging the viewer. It took me a few minutes to realize why the camera lens was in a severe state of vertigo the first 15 minutes into the film. Thank goodness however the entire movie was not filmed using this technique ! Probably would have passed out. The reason for the swirling and sickening motion of the lens and the droning of the high tech synth sound of the soundtrack in the beginning is to capture  the madness of the moment of how one man and his friend are seeking vengeance for a heinous crime (rape) committed against his girlfriend. It also transports you into his head.The entire story is told in a backwards sort of chronological order leading to previous possible events and circumstances that led to Monica Belucci's character becoming a rape victim. The rape scene is one of the most graphic I have seen in any film in my entire life ! You will begin to actually wonder if the scene indeed was real or not. The rape scene alone is one that can haunt the viewer for time to come. Other violent acts are just as equally shocking and extremely believable due to excellent makeup, special effects, and possible cg effects. There is frontal nudity of both male and female actors that may offend some viewers (this is definitely not for children, either)!The biggest mind trick played on the audience is how the movie progresses in real viewing time, yet, you must keep in mind that the story is unfolding backwards. Hence leading to the beginning and not the end. As we follow Belluci's character and the others one soon almost forgets the first 15 shocking minutes of the film, including the underpass rape scene, and start to think that there is a happy ending. There is NO happy ending (nor beginning for that matter)...I went out on a limb to see this one, particularly since Roeper and Ebert raved about it. Well, in all honesty, it is a very brutal movie to sit through the first time and it is definitely not one I will be seeing again.

"I'll review the movie in a moment. What I want to share first is how pleasantly surprised I am at the extras included. Sure, they could have given us more--four different kinds of trailers, costume design boards, a scene from every Phantom movie thus far, interviews with Crawford and Brightman, not to mention commentaries. But hey, isn't that what Christmas is for? :)However, I was enthralled by the story of how the musical came to be. We get not only plenty of airtime from Lord Webber and Stilgoe & Hart, but we see the original stars in footage that we would never be able to see otherwise. Sara Brightman singing ""Pie Jesu"" in what looks to be a cathedral, Michael Crawford doing light comedy--light comedy!--on a British show and performing in the circus. We're taken into Webber's estate to view the singers who first performed the Phantom material as it was being constructed, and are enlightened as to how Britain charmingly previewed the musical, via music video, to the rest of the nation as what looked to be, quite literally, a rock opera. (Well, it WAS the 80s.)The other extras that focus on the movie production are also quite good. I thought it might be only a slightly longer version of one of those HBO First Looks, but it was super-informative. In it you get a look at the premier, at part of Emmy Rossum's screen test, the fun of trying to understand Jennifer Ellison's (Meg) accent, Patrick Wilson singing opera in sport pants, the Mask of the Red Death swigging from a water bottle, plus a look at the outrageously elaborate costumes and what the chandelier falling looked like in real life. There's so much more I can't remember, but trust me, it's worth it.I'm not sure sure about the additional scene. I'm glad they didn't keep it in. While it's a lovely song, the Phantom was too soft, not at all obsessive or dangerous. And we don't want that, now, do we?And, about that movie. Emmy Rossum has a perfectly capable voice even at her age, just as Christine is supposed to be quite young. But her face had the same expression on it--trancelike--almost the entire time. When she saw Raoul caught in the Punjab lasso and cried out, I was like, Finally! And then she went back into the trance. I wish they had coaxed more expression out of her.Gerard Butler. Either you love him or you hate him. We all know he's hot. I was really surprised at first sight of the Phantom, because from the stage shows you get the impression that even with the mask on, he's a crowish figure of no less than forty years. I enjoy watching Butler, but if they had used someone less attractive I don't think it would have taken anything away from the movie. As for his voice--I whispered to my mom at one point that he sounds like a rock star. And yes, Butler was indeed in a rock band. He's no Michael Crawford. And sometimes his treatment of phrases isn't the best. But on the flip side, sometimes it's just as uncomfortable listening to a stage Phantom sing in full-on operatic mode. It's...whatever you like, I guess.Of course, the sets are lavish and the costumes lush (and vice versa). I love Minnie Driver in the Carlotta role, and the men who played the managers were really a delight. I know people gripe about all these different things--the addition of scenes, speaking dialogue that was previously sung, the misplacement of the chandelier's big scene, a colorful masquerade being clothed in black and white. But in the end I still think the movie is more than worth it. Why?Because you can see it whenever you want to now. Because the full orchestra sounds heaven-sent. Because knowing all the words to a musical is a big deal. Because it's beautiful. Because it's a full-on experience that requires nothing less than your full attention. Because snow and confetti falling never looked so perfect. Because my first exposure to the musical was on a cassette tape with half the second act missing and it was still so potent that I stayed up to listen to it again. Because the Phantom's hot (oops).So, that's what I think. If you truly love the musical, you'll like the movie. If you knew nothing of the musical before, then you'll probably like it, too.

While it's a lovely song, the Phantom was too soft, not at all obsessive or dangerous. And we don't want that, now, do we?And, about that movie. Emmy Rossum has a perfectly capable voice even at her age, just as Christine is supposed to be quite young. But her face had the same expression on it--trancelike--almost the entire time. When she saw Raoul caught in the Punjab lasso and cried out, I was like, Finally! And then she went back into the trance. I wish they had coaxed more expression out of her.Gerard Butler. Either you love him or you hate him. We all know he's hot. I was really surprised at first sight of the Phantom, because from the stage shows you get the impression that even with the mask on, he's a crowish figure of no less than forty years. I enjoy watching Butler, but if they had used someone less attractive I don't think it would have taken anything away from the movie. As for his voice--I whispered to my mom at one point that he sounds like a rock star. And yes, Butler was indeed in a rock band. He's no Michael Crawford. And sometimes his treatment of phrases isn't the best. But on the flip side, sometimes it's just as uncomfortable listening to a stage Phantom sing in full-on operatic mode. It's...whatever you like, I guess.Of course, the sets are lavish and the costumes lush (and vice versa). I love Minnie Driver in the Carlotta role, and the men who played the managers were really a delight. I know people gripe about all these different things--the addition of scenes, speaking dialogue that was previously sung, the misplacement of the chandelier's big scene, a colorful masquerade being clothed in black and white. But in the end I still think the movie is more than worth it. Why?Because you can see it whenever you want to now. Because the full orchestra sounds heaven-sent. Because knowing all the words to a musical is a big deal. Because it's beautiful. Because it's a full-on experience that requires nothing less than your full attention. Because snow and confetti falling never looked so perfect. Because my first exposure to the musical was on a cassette tape with half the second act missing and it was still so potent that I stayed up to listen to it again. Because the Phantom's hot (oops).So, that's what I think. If you truly love the musical, you'll like the movie. If you knew nothing of the musical before, then you'll probably like it, too.

"Grab a box of tissues, a snack, and sit back to watch a movie that'll change your life in my opinion, so much that you'll never be the same. Courageous is the story of four policemen who are also after a time, four brothers in the Lord. The Police scenes are all very realistic (and I am one who once spent a lot of time around a police station working where I did.) and some scenes will have you hanging on to your seat! There are happy moments, very sad moments (thus the tissues!), lots of drama both as Policemen in uniform and at home with their families. Along the way, a 'handy man' named Harvee' becomes ""adopted by their group"" as character Adam Mitchell played by Alex Kendrick, one of the movie's writers, put it, after being hired to help Adam (Kendrick) build a garage as he is praying for work and Adam is actually waiting for a handyman referred to him by his fellow officer/best friend Shane - named Harvey! A VERY funny scene where Harvey is working on the garage when the guys are out for lunch and Shane reveals that his friend Harvey is in the hospital! Same name - different Harvey, another funny scene that goes into the saddest scene of the film. (which I won't give away)  After the mix up though, they become good friends and Harvey begins a full time job that Adam referred him for and the test given him is one given to many in real life, yet as the actors say, few can seem to pass it. You find yourself cheering Harvey's character on throughout the movie for his job searching, deep faith, and his portrayl of one the ""Street Kings."" (prepare for a laugh until you cry moment!) Personally,that's one of my favorite scenes! Many poignant family moments combined with police on the job action and a main storyline woven in as smoothly as silk with a message so powerful about fathers and family that your own life may be changed in that area. Many scenes in this movie softens hearts and for me anyway, gave me the desire to be the best woman/Christian/wife/mother I can possibly be. I've seen amazing changes in my husband, and that's seldom seen just from seeing a movie but - the message of being the BEST father and husband that leads his home by the Word of God Courageous is SO very powerful and makes you feel every emotion you possibly feel. Whether Christian or not, I HIGHLY recommend Courageous. My husband and I watch our copy at least twice a week, it's THAT good. Best news is, it has so many powerful scenes that while watching with several non-Christians, two gave their lives to Christ after seeing it with us! Whether a couple in their 50s with children and grandchildren like us, or a Church group - young or old, I just cannot recommend Couragous more! I PRAY that the Kendrick brothers actually read these reviews, as we would LOVE to see MANY MORE movies written/made by them. Lots of talent, both in storylines and in acting. Actors & actresses chosen completely fit the parts and this also is the same with their other films: their first, Flywheel, also Facing the Giants (watching as I type this!) and Fireproof. ALL wonderful in their own ways. We HAD to own them all! You'll NOT be sorry viewing and purchasing this gem, whether Christian or non. Thank you, Kendrick brothers, for wonderful family entertainment - Christian or non -Courageouswith a message that touches hearts and leaves us craving much more!  A MUST SEE! For us, 5 stars isn't enough, it's THAT good! Many fathers, especially Christian fathers, will have a difficult time remaining seated in the final scene, when Adam is speaking at church about dads and their being Godly and Courageous dads, husbands, and men during the call for such dads who are among those the most courageous for God and family.By the way -- ALL the actors are members of a Sherwood Church in Albany,Georgia. I think that's AMAZING! (I pray that the town is correct - I forget the denomination of the church, but all the actors are members of that church, also all their movies are made with ONE camera - this is info from one of the extras parts of the DVD - and to me that's far MORE than just another amazing blessing!)

"I really wanted to like this movie, and, admittedly, there are some good moments.  But seeing as the studio gave Bryan Singer all the money in the world, plenty of time, and quite a bit of creative control and artistic license (I cannot imagine that DC comics was eager to have Superman portrayed as a deadbeat dad!), there should be more than just a few good moments.  Here are the main problems, in no particular order:1) Brandon Routh is not a good Superman.  When he is Clark Kent, he mostly closely resembles Max Fisher from `Rushmore.'  But Max Fisher would have been a better actor.  The worst thing is, and I don't know this was Routh's idea or Singer's, but he does a note-for-note impersonation of Christopher Reeves.  IMO this is just plain ghoulish, considering that the beloved Reeves died just 2 years before this movie.  The various James Bond actors have all played the character with at least slight differences.  Each actor playing Superman has, up to this point, played the character very differently: Kirk Allyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, and Dean Caine each brought a different interpretation of the character.  Why in heaven's name Singer had Routh simply ape Reeves is beyond all comprehension, unless Routh is simply so horrible an actor that he could not be allowed to make the role his own.  On the plus side, Brandon Routh has caused me to give greater respect to Kirk Allyn, and to put George Reeves and Christopher Reeve upon even higher pedestals.2) Kate Bosworth is simply the weakest, blandest, most boring Lois Lane ever.  Not only is there no chemistry with Routh, she has no chemistry with anyone.  She appears simply to have been cast for physical attractiveness and demographic appeal.  But on the upside, she enhances my already great appreciation of Noel Niell, Phyllis Coates, and Margot Kidder.3) Kevin Spacey is usually a good actor, and I guess you could say he gives a good performance here, but ultimately I think he is not quite what Lex Luthor should be.  But maybe if he'd had a decent script.  I don't object to Luthor being played as a closeted gay, Lyle Talbot played Luthor that way in the 1950 movie serial.  But ultimately Spacey is a little camp in the role, even more camp than Gene Hackman in 1978.4) Ultimately, the script is bad.  [SPOILER ALERT:] As much as it must have simply reeked with dramatic temptations, the idea that shortly after bedding Lois, Superman would just fly off into space for 5 years is absurd and offensive.  The real Superman, being raised on Kansas farm, would have too much Midwestern sexual guilt to permit him to just desert Lois for 5 years while she incubates his baby and marries someone else.  This is creepy.  Also, there is a scene in which Superman uses his X-ray vision to spy at Lois, her husband and baby in their home.  I'm sorry, but Superman should not be a Superstalker.5) Speaking of the script, there is a lack of internal logic regarding kryptonite.  [SPOILER ALERT:] Supposedly the kryptonite in Luthor's artificial island makes Superman as weak as drugged kitten.  Yet 15 minutes later, Superman is supposedly able to lift the whole daggum island up and carry it into outer space.6) There is the reuse of Marlon Brando's voice and John Williams' musical score from the 1978 Superman movie.  While these things were good in the original context, in this film they, along with his star's attempt to channel Christopher Reeve serve to create the impression that Bryan Singer really has nothing new to add to the Superman mythos, that he is flailing blindly here, creating sound and fury, but signifying nothing.And that is the thing.  Nothing that is new in this film is any good, and all the good things were already done in various, earlier celluloid incarnations.  And so, the upside is that this DVD has sent me happily back the `Adventures of Superman' TV show.  You are far better off viewing those concise and charming episodes than in owning this pretentious piece of grave robbery.

"Actually, ""Dennis the Menace"" is probably the better movie, in retrospect.I just saw ""Revenge of the Sith"" last night, and it reminded me how awful ""Attack of the Clones"" truly is; not because ""Sith"" is a good movie, but because it was pretty much on the same level.Anyway, two stars for ""Clones"" may indeed be on the generous side; I will concede the two for the amazing CGI (which, simultaneously, is part of the reason why this film is so terrible). Terrible acting? Got it. Terrible directing? Gotcha. No intelligence, heart, emotion, or, well...anything else aside from CGI? Done. Lucas has really outdone himself with this film; it may even be worse than ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and comes darn close to matching ""Terminator 3"" for worst prequel/sequel ever made. The power of hype in our society is truly astounding; despite the fact that not even a labotomized twelve-year old (for whom, according to Lucas's pathetic excuse, the picture is designed (minus the labotomy, of course)) could keep their eyes open long enough to witness this spasm-inducing lethargy, it made nearly $300 mill. at the box office. Of course, the power of hype made the original ""Star Wars"" the biggest success of all time (inflation-adjusted, it's nearly double ""Titanic""), despite the fact that that movie really isn't all that amazing either (that's another story...).The problem with ""Clones,"" and ""Menace"" and ""Sith,"" (and even the original ""Star Wars"") is George Lucas. Good writer, he is (note ""Indiana Jones""); good director, he is clearly not. He should have handed this series to Spielberg, but naturally his ego got in the way. Too bad, because had ""Menace"" been the great film it needed to be, this could have become the most popular trilogy of all time. Like the new ""Matrix"" and ""Terminator"" ""films,"" all we can do is simply forget that these pre/sequels exist, so that we can retain some enjoyment from the originals (in regard to retaining enjoyment from the ""Star Wars"" series, I'm talking about episodes 5 and 6, the only two good movies of them all).A side note: the line of dialogue refering to Anakin's dislike for sand may just be the most laughable ever spoken in an American film.

"""Thank You for Smoking"" was an entertaining movie. I enjoyed the portrayal of corporate shenanigans and its satire of Hollywood types. The acting was good and all players did their jobs well but I was a bit put off by the smirking 'we're so smart and hip attitude' of the movie. A bit of humbleness is appealing you know. Some say the subject matter in this film i.e. to smoke or not to smoke is equally weighed. I personally didn't feel that way at all. I felt the overall tone for the movie was geared toward smoking. Personally, I don't smoke but I don't mind that this film is for smoking. What I liked about the film is that it kept my brain going. And like I said majority of this film is predictable, but you do begin to question how free the rights of the American Public are? Should smoking be banned or should smokers have their rights too? Like stated in the film people know smoking is bad yet they still do it. Why? The movie puts a nice spin on the importance of information and looking at things from alternative views.It's nice to see Aaron Eckhart play a good solid role for once. I think his performance in this film was excellent and extremely believable. I think after this role we will be seeing him in more movies. William H. Macy also stars and shines yet again. Macy is one of the best actors in Hollywood who for years still never got the appreciation he deserves. Also Katie Holmes does a decent job although her character is extremely predictable. I personally think Holmes does a good job at playing bad girl roles like her role here and in ""The Gift"". The reason I think that is because she looks so innocent so when she comes out saying something like ""I want to f*** you, when I watch you on TV"" it seems out of the ordinary for her. This is also probably another reason why Tom Cruise loves her; she's probably a very bad girl outside the public eye.Even though this is Jason Reitman's first feature film he is one to keep an eye on. I feel as the time goes on he will become a very big director just like his father. Being that ""Smoking"" is his first film, I think he has already hit a home run. I think the guy has talent and as long as he keeps making good movies he will be just as big as his dad is someday.I like the message behind ""Thank You For Smoking"" but not the overall subject matter of the film. This movie provides its audience with fine acting, a good script and some nice directing. The film's idea also keeps its audience thinking. It's a good movie to watch with someone and then have a nice long talk with about it afterwards. It's a satirical look at the smoking issue although I still feel it tilts more towards one side than the other.

I, like Johnny Depp, would run home from school and watch Dark Shadows.  I loved it because it was unique.  Let's face it, TV in the 70's was terrible and Dark Shadows, even though they considered it a soap, was refreshing.  All the actors do an excellent job and the movie is hilarious!  The only way they could have pulled it off was making it a comedy and the only people who could pull that off are Burton and Depp.  I loved the music throughout the movie so much that I immediately bought the soundtrack.

"I had to reconsider both my original review of this flick and ""Clones"" after having actually watched both movies w/I a week of each other.  After the initial letdown of ""Episode-I"", I was ready to jump on the ""Episode-II"" bandwagon.  In retrospect, while they both share some flaws, in many respects ""Menace"" is actually superior to ""Clones"".""The Phantom Menace"" has a comparatively simple plot - an intergalactic commercial group called the ""Trade Federation"" suddenly turns militant in the face of burdensome taxation.  They blockade the backwater world of Naboo, threatening an all-out war if their demands aren't met.  Why the Federation has taken that strategy is a mystery to the ruling government - the Senate of the Intergalactic Republic.  Because the galaxy is largely at peace (except for pockets of lawlessness) there is no standing army.  Instead, the Republic relies on the Jedi Knights - warriors schooled in the power of The Force - to maintain peace.  When Jedi Knights Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) find themselves unable to forestall a war, they rescue Naboo's elected ruler Queen Amidala (Portman) from certain capture.  Having escaped the Federation, Amidala's damaged ship is forced to make emergency repairs on an even more remote planet - Tatooine.  Needing parts to fix their ship, and with nobody willing to accept their Republic Credits (even when prodded by Jedi mind tricks), Qui Gonn and Padme (one of the queen's loyal handmaidens) enlist the help of a local slave named Anakin.  He's just a kid, but even Qui-Gonn can tell that the boy has the power of the force flowing through him.  Soon the quest to repair the ship and escape to the Capitol of the Republic includes a mission to save Anakin as well, determine the nature of the Force energy coursing through him and to evaluate him for entry into the Jedi.This flick was a letdown in many ways, but it does have some qualities that survive repeat viewings.  Visually, it is spectacular - the final dogfight between the Federation and the Naboo was not topped or even equaled in ""Clones"".  Both films have epic battles involving computer-animated combatants, but the Gungans have more character than the clone army (though I wouldn't want to face-off either side, ridiculous characters are better than none at all, and the clones are utterly lacking in that area).  The story is simple - though the more complex plot of ""Clones"", with its many continuity lapses and gaps reveal that its makers have a narrative problem which is best served by keepings things simple.  Both films are marked by an epic Jedi duel, though the one in ""Clones"" was strikingly unspectacular.  Christopher Lee as Dooku also demonstrated that he can function quite well as an all-around lord of Evil in ""The Lord of the Rings"", but the script gives him little to do, and the story can't make up its mind as to whether we're supposed to think he might be good, or banish any idea that he's not utterly evil.  In contrast, Ray Park as Darth Maul is utterly drenched in evil, his face and body language communicating a very palpable sense of the Sith - the force of evil Jedi ready to tear the galactic order to shreds.  Maul's battle royale - alone against Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan easily rivals that between Vader and Luke from ""Return of the Jedi"" in its narrative coherency, and is only clearly topped in that respect by Luke and Vader's duel from ""Empire"".  While we can lament that ""Episode One"" wasn't the kind of film that grabbed us from our first viewing (like ""Star Wars"" or ""Raiders"") it's still a film that can grab us.

"first of all, for Aliens versus Predator, you have to go in with an open mind, don't go in thinking of Arnold or Danny Glover and their role in this movie, cause it won't work.with that, here is my take on the movie and how it goes.movie starts off solid, satelitte belonging to Weyman corporations gets a heat plume in anartica, so he gathers a team involving the best diggers in the world, an archelogical team, and an ice tour guide to lead the team. they end up isolated in an island a 1,000 miles from land where they discover a tunnel was made 24 hours prior to their arrival by somebody, and this leads to an underground pyramid, where the heat source is coming from.they enter the pyramid, and set off a chain of reactions, releasing the Aliens, then mess up big by taking the predator's weapons, and this is where the actions really kicks in.only 3 predators are sent against a handful of aliens and people. as for the storyline, here is how it goes.the predators taught humans to build pyramids and used them for sacrifice to help create the aliens, which they would then turn around and hunt down.if they beat the aliens, then they proved themselves worthy, but if they lost, then they blew up everything. in doing this, they captured the alien queen to make eggs then lured the humans for sacrifice, but when a couple of the predators get killed by the aliens, everything is left to one predator and one human.the movie is awesome, the build up to the fight scenes is awesome, and best of all, the aliens-predator fight scenes are awesome. they fight in these awesome battles to the death, and some of the battle scenes and who dies and how is surprising.overall, the movie is awesome, and the ending is clever too, which leads to a possible AVP 2.

"I can understand why everyone would want this to succeed, but there are three reasons why it didn't. First of all, you would think Warner Brothers would learn from the reinvention of the Batman franchise they nearly killed. I always thought the target audience should be adults, and then would eventually make it down to kids. This kind of campy storytelling will not be tolerated by the public at large anymore.Secondly, I felt there was some sentimental value attached to this film due to the passing of Christopher and Dana Reeve to not allow a more objective critique of the film. I'm not coming down on Brandon Routh at all. I think he did a wonderful job taking the Superman mantle. Aside from a few poor casting choices (Bossworth and Posey). The cast carries out very good performances. Not surprising was Kevin Spacey's marvelous performance as Lex Luthor. While clearly differing from Hackman's performance. Spacey offers a more jubulent take which adds more depth to the character.And third, what made this film lose its cohesiveness was the direction of the story. Bryan Singer did a great job of re introducing the characters. But after that failed to take the movie in a clear direction. So in truth, you only need to see the first half of the film. After the second half you might end up scratching your head.A shout to the people at Warner Brothers. You boys clearly don't have a clue wether you have a good thing or a bad thing so I'll make this real simple. Either hire a competent writer to tell a good story or sell the rights to make these movies. Superman is a good character with a wealth of material in the mythos to use.

"The third installment is much better and more memorable than the first two films. It's tough adapting an excellent book into an excellent film. Things are left out and new things are put in. The first two films left me wondering why more wasn't cut out of them to make for better movie viewing. It was like they were trying to cram as much of the book in as possible, resulting in drawn out stories. In stark contrast, this Potter film moves along at a pace I can stand, isn't as long (great for the attention span of children), is better written, directed, and played out.The three young actors (Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson) have finally come into their own and look like they know what their doing. Radcliffe (Harry Potter) gives his best performance yet, and I'm sure we'll see even more growth in the coming movies.In this installment, we learn that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison and is after Harry Potter. That's the shortest version of the plot (there's more to it, but I don't want to be too long-winded), and I don't want to reveal too much more for the sake of those who may not have the read the book.Fanatics of the book may not appreciate that some of the book was left out, but if the entire book was adapted to film, the movie would be 10 hours long. For the sake of entertainment purposes, I'm glad director Cuaron took the edgy route. He gives us an excellent film, the best Potter film yet. Even the vision of Harry Potter is different. I thought this film had a better  feel for the book, even if it left stuff out.I've seen it twice, once in a regular theater and once in an IMAX.

"The Prestige (2006)Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David BowieChristopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts. It's clever stuff.

"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***A historical costume drama with some powerful performances, THE DUCHESS is the study of The Duchess of Devonshire and her battles with The Duke during their strained marriage.Little known director Saul Dibb gets a dream cast in Keira Knightley (Atonement) as The Duchess and Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardener) as The Duke. Thanks to Fiennes' uber-talent as a powerhouse actor, he helps pull the entire production up several rungs. Knightley shines unexpectedly bright in her role as the clothes-designing Duchess who steps into royalty and a marriage of the times; that is to say, something completely foreign to those of us in today's world.By contract, she is to be honorable and deliver the Duke an heir: a son. But three girls later and the Duke is becoming restless. He finds lust wherever his loins take him and the Duchess must simply bear it. A friend and confidant, Bess (Hayley Atwell), soon turns into a lady of conflict as she sleeps with, and then moves in with, the Duke. The Duchess tries to settle the matter but the Duke's power won't allow her any leeway.When a past love arrives in the Duchess' life, a powder keg erupts. Mr. Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper,Mamma Mia!) turns the Duchess' life upside down, and when she becomes pregnant with his child, the Duke's orders force her into an impossible situation: give the baby up (and give up Mr. Grey) or never see your children again.The terrible power wielded by The Duke is pulled off exceptionally well thanks to the high performance of Ralph Fiennes. Surprisingly you loathe him and then, as the film progresses, you actually pity him when he says things like, ""Look at them. To be that free."" His job and title have strapped him down and drove him into this role.The forced and eventual consummated acceptance of the Duke's power is probably Keira Knightley's strongest reveal for her since I've been watching her flicks.The costumes and sets are stunning in their elegance and appropriateness, as is the believable love that future Prime Minister Grey (yes, he actually becomes Prime Minister) and the Duchess feel for one another, even when forced apart by society and their own lives.This is a wonderfully done film with plenty of eye-candy sets and dark characters to make most movie watchers delight.

"The first season was pretty good. There were some changes from the book, but the story still flowed. Season two is just getting on my nerves! The changes made are absolutely ridiculous. The Jon Snow and Ygritte scenario made me stop watching and I'm not sure if I can continue. I sorta wish I didn't read the books because then maybe I would enjoy this series more.The actor and character of Theon's sister is atrocious. The story of Daenerys is horrible. The battle between the Kings guard and the Black recruits was way underplayed, and the flow of Arya's journey was cut and changed way too much. I could go on and on. I know I should expect changes, but this was written and directed as if both writer and director did not read and love the books. And I truly don't understand how the ratings are high from people who did read the books.Well, finished watching, finally. I'm totally disgusted. I just have no words to say how bad it is.

"It may be Mat Damon himself.  Surely the leading man in a film of this kind is important, but at first glance, Damon has none of the obvious traits.  He isn't killer handsome.  Neither has he the body of a circus ariealist.  What he's got, it seems to me, is the ability to remind you of a younger brother who enlisted in the Navy and somehow wound up in the Seals.  Nobody had any idea.  One minute he's the hot-shot of the High School Baseball team, the next minute you're watching him get decorated dressed in whites.  You're so proud of him, even if you don't know what it is he does, precisely, and all your family loves him.So, as I say, no International Lounge Lizard with nouveau riche tastes, or a necklace of Euro-Trash beauties around his neck.But, when the movie begins and they haul him out of the sea, nearly dead, you see it.  And as he recovers from his wounds, it becomes clearer.  He's one of the brightest and the best; clean as a whistle, sharp as a tack.  Dad's favorite boy, memory clouded, somehow, and on a mission even he doesn't remember.  And whithout making any judgment about it, you've got a great deal invested in him; in seeming him safe and his enemies identified and routed.  Therefore, when the action begins, and it does immediately, one watches him negotiate the thorny mazes of predicaments of incredible complexity and menace, with ingenuity and dispatch.  One of the best demonhstrations of what he can do happens when he arrives in Paris, after getting his money and passports out of a Swiss bank.  ANd himself and a German girl of some sort with a car, out of the American Embassy trap.  Well, an assassion crashes into his Paris apartment before either of them can catch a breath, and there's a life and death flght which ends when the failed assassin thorws himself out of the window and dies on the sidewalk below.  That is the prelude to as brilliant and harrowing a demonstration of trick driving as I've ever seen, as Borne and the girl drive her Cooper Mini through the mazes and tangles of fast, congested Parisian traffic, followed by police cruisers and motorcycle mounted cops.  Thrilling!  And that's just the first third of the film.Rather than describe the remainder of the story in detail, I will say, instead, that the director does not allow the project to make any fatal mistakes.  He doesn't flirt with us; doesn't try to seduce us into liking the movie with mugging or stupid action jokes.  He doesn't use kids that way.  Or animals.  Or any people.  There are no faux literary pretensions anywhere.  Although there are people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in the film, there's no ethnic or racial humor.  There are no shameful and insincere attempts to conjure up a facile moral to the story by juggling religioius symbols.  The sexual attraction of the hero and heroine to one another isn't either lewd or tricky, but grows inevitably out of the inter-reliance that builds between them as they cling to life and avoid discovery.  What attracts her is his freshness, frankness, fearlessness and his determination to protect her from enemies that are really his alone.  Their care for each other becomes as artless and as inevitable as sunrise.The sound track is good and the intercut POP music is as one would expect it, but the music is never distracting.Seems to me I've watched this show 3 times now, and it looks better and better every time.

"Though Peter Jackson had always claimed that the 208 minute (roughly equal to ""Seven Samurai"" in length) DVD version of ""Lord of the Rings'"" first installment was not a director's cut, its vast superiority to the shortened theatrical release becomes clear immediately.For those initally dissapointed with ""Fellowship's"" overly fast pace (skipping over characterizations and details for the sake of action) , the seamlessly integrated 30 minutes of footage works wonders.Here are some Improvements:1) Instead of a mere adventure movie (or a cgi cartoon, some may argue), Jackson's FOTR now feels closer to the spirit of Tolkien's world. Through more maps, longer stays at various crucial locations, more journey time, more geographic and historical references, one finaly begins to get a sense of original work's epic scope. In fact, there are a few scenes where the dialogue is copied almost verbatim, and that's always a welcomed addition.2) Every character (even Gollum) gets at least some additonal exposure and all are considerably fleshed out. Aragorn benefits the most, now seeming more like a full-fledged human being (within epic conventions, though), rather than a straight-forward action hero. Galadriel, called a ""radioactive psycho"" by some, has other scenes here showing her true regal nature. Merry, Pippin, and especially Gimli, are more than buffoons to liven up the proceedings. Ian Holm's Bilbo, who was one of my favorite character portrayals in the film, also gets more screen time in the beginning, just like Tolkien wrote.3) The overall themes of the book are now much more apparent - the ring's temptation, the weakness of humans, the appeal of a simple lifestyle over industrialization, and the dissappearance of civilizations (elves). The Passing of the Elves scene, is quite amazing - a shame to have been cut in the first place, as it is fairly short.4) Some of the choppier and confusing parts of the theatrical version are elaborated upon and some questions are answered, such as ""How did the Ring betray Isildur ?"", or ""Why is Boromir so preoccupied with the Ring?"" Although Sam is not explicitly introduced as Frodo's servant, he is at least shown gardening at Bag End.Many complaints that I, and other fans of the book, had with the theatrical version are now fully resolved, and by all standards, as a whole this is a much better film, already approaching that sought-after but seldom-attained classic status in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Approaching, but still stopping short of perfection, because many of the fundamental issues persist.Here are my remaining Problems with FOTR in order of annoyance:1) Gratuitous use (or abuse, rather) of slow motion - esp. in the ""Noooooooooo"" scene right after Gandalf's fall in Moria, and the ""drowning"" of Sam scene. Cheesy and detracting.2) Overbearing, generic, omni-present score. Some scenes, like Boromir's attempt to take the ring, and his death, while well-acted, should have been fine without the bathetic, cringe-worthy accompaniment. Sometimes, silence can be just as effective in generating the proper emotions. Granted, the music is not all terrible, it's just excessive - but the cliched chanting has got to go.3) While I can forgive Merry and Pippin's all-too-fast integration into the Fellowship, The Council of Elrond scene, even with the additions (which help) still doesn't quite work. Oh well, at least we get to hear the actual ""ash nazg durbatuluk"" speach by Gandalf. And, there's a funny hidden parody of the scene on one of the DVDs.4) Saruman is still the cartoonish villain, with no extra depth.The Extra materials on the DVD are top-notch, and as you may have heard, go into minute detail regarding all the aspects of production. They will take hours of viewing, if you care enough to investigate. Some of the audio commentaries are interesting as well - it looks like the presence of Philippa Boyens who was a harder Tolkienite than the action-oriented Jackson, helped steer certain scenes into the right direction. And without Richard Taylor, Alan Lee and John Howe, the visuals (best thing about the film in the first place) would not have been possible. We also get some discussion about New Zealand (interactive map provided) and the filming locations.In summary : if you even remotely liked the film you saw a year ago, were hoping for an improvement, and did not make the mistake of purchasing the theatrical DVD in August - by all means get this one!

"A lot of King fans will want to bash my head in after saying that, but this director took what I found to be a long, drawn out story, and sculpted it into 96 minutes of a highly entertaining film.Of course, as was stated in other reviews here, Johnny Depp really pulls this one off as in most of his films. They really took you into Mort Rainey's cracked world within the peaceful lake house. They had a different ending here than was in King's story and it worked fabulous.

"I went to see Love Actually three times in the theaters.  It was heart-warming and wonderful, sad and depressing, silly and did I say wonderful.

"I think everyone judges every Star Wars movie by what is considered the best of the batch, the original Star Wars of 1977 and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of 1980. Compared with those movies, this movie is not so great. Compared to the other two prequels, it is the best of the three. It turns away from the tortuous details of Senate politics that infected its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"", and tries to get back to the action, relationships, and moral dilemmas that are at the heart of the ""Star Wars"" series. However, this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more of a conscientious effort by creator, director, and writer George Lucas.It basically forms a straight line, plot-wise, from Episode Two to Episode Four with no surprises and little character development, and depends upon what you already know about the entire Star Wars mythology to invest you in this movie and its characters rather than the action and dialogue of this one particular film. Also, there is little use made of either Natalie Portman's  Padme Amidala - who actually has very little screen time - or the excellent Samuel L. Jackson, who is completely wasted given the small part that his character has in this film. Why employ such a great actor if you are going to give him lines that any extra could deliver?Additionally, for someone who has spent the last ten or fifteen years learning and living the ways of the Jedi, Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker seems to have very little inner turmoil making a sudden and complete transformation from protector of innocents to the apprentice of evil. He irrationally uses his desire to ensure his wife's safety - when there is no perceivable threat to her health other than his own premonitions - as an excuse to savage anyone who might get in his way and even some who couldn't if they wanted to, such as the ""younglings"" that he slaughters in the Jedi temple at Palpatine's behest. Thus the so-called transformation into Darth Vader is more like the flipping of a switch - more binary than analog.The best performance is that of Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine/""The Emporer"". He has a serpentine smoothness about him as he subtly plants doubts in Skywalker's mind about who is really on the side of evil while deftly handling all of the warring factions of the Republic so that people will actually be grateful when he takes complete power.In summary, if you have seen all of the other Star Wars films you will probably enjoy this one because it fills in all of the gaps and answers all of the remaining questions. However, with some more effort in the direction and writing, those questions could have been answered with much better dialogue and characters that were more three-dimensional.

"Safe to say this film was very poor. Considering recent comic book adaptations have for the most part been excellent of late this was a major disapointment, I would consider Batman and Robin more entertaining.Acting wise the movie is poor, Eric Bana's accent is bad considering how poor his fellow Aussies do with accents thats saying alot. The emotions run from depressed to really depressed, to super depressed, their was no range of emotions, no smiles, just constant monotone sadness. Nolte seems drunk or on drugs in the film which probably isn't short of the truth. The bad guy actors seem to have little to no motivation in the film and have absolutely no reason to act in the manner which they do.

"The Twilight Saga is unavoidable in both film and book form. The books, which I've never read, were bestsellers and the recent release of ""New Moon,"" the film is breaking records. Teenage girls are absolutely gaga for the star Robert Pattinson and it finally intrigued me enough to watch this film. I do have a slightly biased opinion as the entire premise of the film seemed ludicrous to me, but I found a glimmer of hope in the film's director Catherine Hardwicke, who was responsible for the very honest look at teenagers with the film ""Thirteen.""What really surprised me about this film is that it doesn't have much of a plot. Kristen Stewart plays Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, who moves from Arizona to Forks, Washington to stay with her father (Billy Burke). Bella inexplicably begins school moments after arriving in Forks and discovers The Cullen's, a group of mysterious foster kids from Alaska. Even more mysterious and intriguing, to her and the rest of the student body, is Edward Cullen (Pattinson), a quiet, pale, reserved 17-year-old. Bella starts to notice the Cullen's are more than just a little different and when Edward stops a van from running her over, she realizes that he may not even be human...99% of the world knows that he's a vampire, but not a vampire of the typical, blood-sucking variety. The Cullen's are ""vegetarian"" vampires who only snack on the blood of animals. There's a story here, obviously but nothing really happens in it.Almost everything here is underwritten, characters and plot included. The characterization is particularly hollow and calling the characters ""characters,"" is inaccurate; these are names with pretty faces attached to them. We're talking about a film here with an uneventful plot and characters completely void of depth. Twilight is supposed to be a supernatural love story geared towards a teenage demographic, but where's the emotion or poignancy that a love story needs in order to work as one? It's certainly not here. The dialogue in this movie is so melodramatic, I almost felt nauseous. The conversations between Bella and Edward are particularly embarrassing to watch. This does not sound like the ""Romeo & Juliet"" of the 21st Century, but the banter of two prepubescent children.  A quick example; ""Beautiful? This is the skin of a killer, Bella.""As for the performances, no one seems to be putting any effort into them. Pattinson looks uncomfortable and his facial expressions, as well as his delivery of the film's dialogue sound pain fully forced. I do believe Hardwicke is a talented director, but she made a lot of poor creative choices here starting with her decision to direct such a poorly written script in the first place. One of her most annoying directorial decisions was her overuse of the slow-motion to illustrate the anxiety of a character. I can say only one positive thing about the film's production value and that is the somber, gray color palette utilized by the film's cinematographer...It could've been really effective if the tone of the overall film had been altered. Anyone who doesn't agree with what I'm saying about the film's poor quality need look no further than the baseball scene. How horribly executed can a scene be? The acting, the dialogue, the choice of music, Pattinson's snarl, and the cinematography are so bad it's embarrassing. Finally, this scene has no relevance to the plot of the film. It's muddled, meandering filler slipped into the film as an excuse to bring the character's to a different conflict in the story. If I was not aware of the inescapable Twilight frenzy, I would swear this film was a direct-to-DVD release; no one with a knowledge or appreciation of American cinema would call Twilight a good movie.Quite frankly, watching Twilight was like watching a high-school play written by a socially inept teenager. Obviously, my opinion isn't going to affect the success of the series. Twilight is one of those things that strikes some chord with young American audiences and has become a record-breaking smash success. I guarantee that Twilight will not remain a part of the American moviegoer's consciousness for any prolonged amount of time and just like hugely successful boy bands, this is a phase that will fade away in time.Twilight left me shaking my head so many times in the two hours I was watching it. I was not fascinated, intrigued, or stimulated about anything going on in the film and the only way I can imagine someone being those things is if they were not educated.

Jess (Parminder Nagra) just wants to play soccer, but her traditional, Indian parents won't hear of it.  They want her to go to college, become a lawyer and be a good Indian wife--let's not forget the cooking lessons her mom wants to subject her to, so she can cook all the curries, breads and assorted fried pastries.

Another young lady (Keira Knightley) sees her playing, and invites her to join a girl's team.  They both proceed to develop crushes on the coach (Jonathan Rhys Myers), and then things get a little complicated......to say the least....also, the whole soccer matter can't be kept under wraps forever.Even though I was never any good at soccer, and don't know much about the game (though, I knew who David Beckham was and that he played for Manchester United at the time that the film came out.......there is even a scene with Jess watching David--or, as her mom likes to call him, &quot;That skinhead boy,&quot; play his &quot;corner&quot;), I had great fun watching Jess triumph in game after game, and enjoyed the Indian flavor that generously sprinkled out this film like fine haldi (tumeric, for those who know it by its Western name) in a savory and spicy curry, meant to be enjoyed with friends and loved ones.

"I have now watched the entire nine season run of ""The X-Files"" from start to finish on DVD and my primary reaction to the final season was that it was not Mulder that I missed for most of these last 20 episodes but Scully.  Gillian Anderson's character is in most of these season nine episodes, but far too often she comes a bit unglued regarding her absent former partner.  Granted, we have enjoyed every one of Scully's emotional outbursts throughout the years, but the explosions strike me as being excessive.  When Scully is forced to play the true believer opposite the skepticism of Doggett, in the more mundane cases investigated this final season, things are fine.  All things considered, the episodes that focus on Agent John Doggett (e.g., ""John Doe,"" ""Underneath,"" ""Release"") are the most interesting in the ninth season.As the final season begins Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) has once again disappeared, but this time of his own choice since he knows his presence is putting Scully and their son William in danger.  Agent Doggett (Robert Patrick) is trying to find Muldar (""Nothing Important Happened Today"") as part of his investigation of Deputy Director Kersh (James Pickens Jr.), but Scully and Assistant Director Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) finally convince him to drop the matter.  Scully is now teaching at the FBI Academy, helping Doggett and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) from time to time, but fully aware that William is in danger.  It is William's fate, even more than Mulder's disappearance, that defines the arc of this final season.While watching these episodes again, at midnight each night, I found myself wondering if the season could have been stronger if not only Mulder but also Scully had been jettisoned and the season had been about agents Doggett and Reyes.  As a general rule in the final seasons I intended to enjoy the standalone investigations (e.g, ""Lord of the Flies,"" ""Scary Monsters""), than those that focus on the show's mythology (e.g., ""Provenance,"" ""Providence"").  The final season is a mix of episodes where one week the focus is primarily on Reyes (""Audrey Pauley"") and the next almost entirely on Doggett (""John Doe"").  Sometimes Dogget and Reyes work together (""Daemonicus"") and then again it could be Reyes and Scully (""Hellbound""), or maybe all three (""Underneath""). Things are clearly progressing more quickly with Doggett and Reyes on the romantic front (""4-D,"" ""Release""), but then you would be hard pressed to name a couple that took longer to be a couple than Mulder and Scully.  In the comedy department that standout episodes is clearly ""Improbable,"" which features Bert Reynolds as a checker-playing God (Einstein always said God did not play dice with the universe, but he never excluded any board games).With one exception, the twisted Brady Bunch tale ""Sunshine Days,"" the final episodes that aired are all about tying up lose ends.  ""Jump the Shark"" becomes the final ride of the Lone Gunmen, ""William"" finds Scully reaching a fateful decision regarding her son, and the best of the bunch, ""Release"" brings closure to the unsolved murder of Doggett's son.  ""The Truth,"" the double-episode finale, proves to be unsatisfying, but I think expectations were so exceedingly high that it was impossible for fans to view the end with anything other than regret.  I like the final fade out, but the trial of Mulder is clearly a mockery, which means we are treading water for most of the story until the big finish because nothing that happens there matters.  There is a big bang near the end, but the saga of Mulder and Scully really ends with silence and a set up that will allow Chris Carter and the gang to do anything they want with the planned second ""X-Files"" movie.  Final Note: It would be my recommendation that you watch all of ""The Lone Gunman"" episodes before or concurrently with ""The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season,"" so that you end you ""X-Files"" experience with ""The Truth"" and not watching ""Jump the Shark"" a second time.

"I have read most of the other reviews on this page. They run the gamut from begrudging tolerance to a downright obnoxiously snotty kid's review.  So why all the poison?  People usually act this way when they're discussing politics or religion.  What the heck's going on here?Something amazing. Most people come away from this work deeply impressed, moved and transformed for LIFE. They feel it is THEIR musical. It is a totally personal, life-changing revelation. It MUST always be the way they experienced it the first time. Hence all the negative rhetoric about the film not being enough of this or that, as opposed to the original cast stage version.Not all musicals achieve such status. Chances are ""Phantom"" will touch you as deeply as it did me.Perhaps you will feel as I did when you see this DVD...that the music and singing are glorious, you will feel that the songs were always a part of you, that the camera seems to lovingly caress every sumptuous set and costume,  that the story is poignant and moving beyond tears.The film is stunning on its OWN terms.

"Okay many have said Lucas made many many many flaws. First off, you people just can not accept a new world of Star Wars. Everyone wanting Episode One to be Anakin discovered at an older age, be a great pilot (no podracing), and in Episode 2 everyone wanted Anakin to become Vader, and in Three they wanted the Purge of the Jedi, and how Obi Wan escpaes, etc.. Well thats not what happened. And Many fans must realize that your all ignorant. Its like when People went to go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Everyone had their mind on the orginal and many hated this new version. Get the sequels out of your head and have an opened mind.Yes Revenge of the Sith had minor flaws, but it is deffinently something new and better than what we have received.Spoilers May Appear!-----First off, Revenge of the Sith has its strong points--Anakin becomes Vader-The Jedi Purge Begins-Palpatine becomes Emperor-The Emperor duels Yoda-The Clone Wars come to an end-The Rebellion starts to formEverything we wanted was in 2 horus and 10 minutes. Now thats what I have to complain about. If Revenge of the Sith was just slightly much longer, like the longest of them all, it would be just as perfect as Empire Strikes Back.Lucas's scenery is beautiful, and the Emperor's performance is astonishing.I loved the entire final duel. I never felt my hair stand up like that when I saw Obi Wan vs. Anakin, as Yoda vs. Sidious, since The final Duel in Return of the Jedi. I liked the idea of having several endings, it completed everything and truly feels Star Wars is complete.There's just a few minor things I wish I have seen:-More of the Death Star being built-More scenes as the Jedi Temple is attacked-A little more dialogue scenes-The Explanation of the Chosen One-Palpatine's background of being a Sith- And seeing Qui Gon's spirit which would have been nice. oh well.So This is my view of how the Star Wars films fall into-From Best to Not So Good :-)1.

"""Jeepers Creepers"" is a movie I remember hearing a lot of mixed buzz about. Some people\critics hailed it as one of the scariest movies ever! While others said it ranks among the worst ever made. I had wanted to see ""Jeepers Creepers"" when it was firsted released,but, just never got around to it. Then, one day I just decided to rent it, since I'm a fan of the genre.""Jeepers Creepers"" is a movie I think that does have some suspenseful moments. I also think the film's first half bour is brilliant. And by that I mean, it's set-up is wonderful. The suspense slowly builds up because we don't know what kind of movie we are in for. We have no way of knowing where this plot will take us. As for dialogue well, the film suffers, and the movie has too many loop holes that don't bring the movie together, plus, it just gets plan silly. But, I'm getting ahead of myself here.""Jeepers Creepers"" starts off as a brother and sister Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving home from school. Soon they encounter a strange driver on the road who nearly runs them right off the road. As they drive on, they see him again, this time, he's off the road, and they see him throwing bodies down a pipe. Now, all of this believe it or not works. But, what happens inbetween this, doesn't work.First of all, the two kids start talking about their mother. Okay, what about her? I don't know. They say that she's change, that she;s not herself anymore. OK, why? Does she have a physical problem? Is she breaking up with her husband? Did her husband die? Or is she just lonely? We never know. Information is given to us, but, it's never completed. We know Trish (Gina Philips) breaks up with her boyfriend, why? The writers were just trying to make this characters have a conversation for the film doesn't become boring until the action happens. But, why make the characters talk about things that won't have anything to do with the movie. We don't want to hear it. Why not try writing USEFUL dialogue?After the first half hour, the film become odd, but, I was willing to go along with it. We find out something about the driver in the begining of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it). And then we start to second guess our opinion of why we rented this in the first place. So now, the film just becomes silly. Here's an example, the kids are soon told they whenever they hear the Harry Warren song ""Jeepers Creepers"" expect trouble. Never in all my life would I have expected the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" to represent evil! Also, we are told that the ""crepper"" attacks ever 23 years! And the funny thing is, no one else knows about this. That leads to another question. Exactly how long has this been going on?Director Victor Salva is not a talentless director I feel. He might be able to actually make a good, scary horror flick one of these days. He just needs to prepare himself better. That's what really breaks this film. The elements are there for a good movie, but, they just weren't used properly. Maybe ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" will be better. Who knows. I personally would advise you not to watch this movie. If you like the teen horror genre I prefer ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", and ""The Glass House"".Bottom-line: Suspensefull, but ultimately silly horror film that just doesn't scare us enough but makes us think of what could of been. Decent acting, so-so scrpit. ANSWERNOTFOUND",How is the suspense?,401,"{'text': [""The suspense slowly builds up because we do n't know what kind of movie we are in for""], 'answer_start': [547]}"
"Spider man 3, the final installment of spider man was, as expected, overdone. it followed the footstep of X-men and Pirates and other trilogies that wanted to end with a gigantic finish...except that the gigantic part was gigantic in all the wrong parts.to start off, 2 villians do keep us entertained...if they actually make sense that is. But both don't. the writers kept it a little too big, basically made both villains nearly invinsible, then at the end gave us a laughable end-of-villian finish. For example the sandman, after he's been bombed at, flushed at, shot at, beat at, thrown at.... and still live on to create more destruction, he just SUDDENTLY realized that what he was doing was wrong and then went like: ""I was wrong, okay now I'm gonna go gone with the wind now"" WHAT?!the venom was about the same thing, an invinsible being who is scared of bell sounds???? it's as ridiculous as saying a dragon is scared of the color red. Not convincing at the least.the theme tried to stick to the whole ""superhero can't have girlfriends and normal life thing"" but it still failed. Because the reasons were pretty damn weak: Peter got bad because he was infected by the venom; Mary-Jane breaks up with Peter for saving his life. none of these things actually SHOWS convincingly that superhero CAN'T have a normal life, just that when new villains came, relationship gets screwed up (the venom just HAPPENS to fall where Peter and Mary Jane is, RIIIIGHT)...which doesn't even make much sense.overall this was a huge disappointing follow-up of the last one, which was the best super-hero movie I have ever seen. the only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because of its special effects, and Toby dancing of course.

"FARGO is a modern classic of cinema.  Period.  One of the things that I enjoy most about the Coen brothers' movies is that they both understand their art form: movies are primarily visual works of art.  Many films forget this fact.  While the plot of FARGO is, in many ways, simple and somewhat predictable, the cinematography is amazing.  The blanket white landscapes that the Coen brothers paint gives the film the elegance of a black & white film with the beauty of a work in color.  The white makes the colors ""pop"" on the screen.FARGO introduces us to another one of William H. Macy's masterful performances.  He plays the perfect Everyman, someone who is absolutely despicable and, yet, manages to win our sympathy.  It is perfect because we see a glimmer of something in his sad existence that reminds us of our own.  He has been pushed around all of his life and one gets the feeling that the world would little remember him if he just fell off the face of the earth.  In a surprising act of agency, he hatches a scheme to accomplish two goals: to gouge his father-in-law for a lot of money (a man whom he has never earned respect) and to gain the necessary funds to fuel a business plan of his own.  The plot is simple: hire two men to kidnap his wife, collect the ransom money from his father-in-law, and give the henchman a fraction of the ransom in exchange for his wife back.  But in FARGO, as in life, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.  One thing after another goes wrong and the body count rises.In the end, FARGO is about following normal, everyday characters (the type William H. Macy was born to play) and placing them in ordinary (yet, at the same time, extraordinary) circumstances and seeing how the haphazardness of life plays with them.  Watch this film.

"and it was called ""Battle Royale"".I just want to say I stand firm on my opinion and review of this movie despite the barrage of spiteful and extremely petty down votes from over obsessive fans of this series looking to smite anyone who has something other than praise to give this adolescent film.I completely loved Battle Royale as it was an amazing and unbelievably good movie. It's hard to watch this and not see the similarities and also knowing that Battle Royale came out 10 years before this movie or book was even thought of. I didn't exactly buy into the hype of this movie because of so and actually took my time before deciding to sit down and watch it for the first time. This movie I think was just a bunch of hype the same as Black Swan and all those others than pop up out of no where and all of a sudden seem to capture the attention of the box office. Maybe it's one of those pictures where the book is different and much better but as a movie this one feels overly long and quite boring in a lot of parts. If you've seen Battle Royale or have not, you should definitely watch it. It goes into detail about the things this movie skimps over and explores the characters on a much deeper level. Watching The hunger games I felt I was watching almost like a B-movie rip off of Battle Royale, or how can I put it... it's a lot more toned down and that's which kills the shock value of the story. I think this is one of those movies you only enjoy if you've read the book and get to see it come alive. As for me it just didn't cut it especially since I've seen this done before only better with a much better plot. I'm sure there's die hard fanatics for ""The hunger games"" but if you've never seen ""Battle Royale"" than you really are just praising a false idol.What makes this movie even more painstaking to watch is that it is long and not very engaging. I found myself pausing the video and running off to do other tasks, and then coming back to it. The movie just seemed to go on and on and on dragging out scenes forever and then having the nerve to give you one of those open endings. This movie is over 2 hours long and the story hardly has any real dialogue to it. You'll find yourself more mesmerized by trying to figure out the ridiculous fashions of this futuristic world. To me that was the more interesting part to watch especially the awkwardly shaped beard of one of the head figure characters. What also struck me was the character Rue and the uproar about the casting for that character. I couldn't believe how nasty people were over the casting of a cute little girl to play her character that basically only had a couple of lines to say. I mean I think if you blinked you'd miss her role in this movie. It really goes to show just how petty certain people can be over absolutely nothing (probably some of these people randomly down voting reviews). Especially in the case of a movie where the race of characters was never described. The biggest surprise was seeing Lenny Kravitz in the film. I didn't even know he was in to acting but his character was random enough so whatever.The one thing I think that really hurt this movie the most was the lack of explanation in the film. The state of the society is never really explained. Why there are 12 districts and all of them are basically low class working districts and the city is lush and rich is never explained. What the ""hunger"" part about the entire game/story is about. They only hint at a scene where the main character is starving in flash backs or surprised to get a piece of bread from a friend saying ""is this real"" but that's all you get. No explanation at all as to why these districts are basically laborers that provide necessities for the well to do but live in poverty themselves. Just from the hints and I mean very few hints in the movie the children fighting all come from these repressed low class labor societies where they are picked at random to fight in these games and chosen to be the victor (btw that plot is never explained you have to piece it together yourself throughout the entire movie). It looked like the participating districts were rewarded with food or something if I saw correctly in the riots (also unexplained) but whatever. This is just a bad movie for lots of reasons but mostly for not explaining things that should be explained like the background for the story at least. There is just a simple clip shown in the movie about a war and the games sort of being like the Olympics to show that courage and strength still exists (yeah, still very pointless).Here's where Battle Royale does everything so much better. The plot of a group of students being forcefully captured by the government and thrown into a Military war/social project called ""The Program"". The kids are handed weapons and supplies at random and told only one of them can survive and they have to kill all of their classmates if they want to make it home alive. The kids don't really understand what is going on (not even the bombs/tracking devices) around their neck. They at first are hesitant to participate in the game but when others start killing each other it suddenly becomes a game of instinct and survival. Some of the kids form social pacts to survive, some like to survive alone, and some just enjoy killing whomever they can find, and some just refuse to participate and try to find another way out. Battle Royale does the story better because its almost like a study of human survival. You get a chance to learn about the background on the characters and their relationship to the other characters which is what makes seeing one of them die or get killed more personal. You don't get to explore any other characters in The Hunger Games but the two main characters ""Bow girl"" and ""Guy who is useless"". There's also Rue who character depth includes ""These are Mocking Jays we use them to signal time in my district"" and that's about as much as you get. For a 2.5hr movie I find The Hunger Games to be extremely vague in a lot of areas it shouldn't be.So basically overall... if you want to see a GOOD movie about Young adults being forced to kill other young adults watch Battle Royale.

"And I say I wasted 1.5 hours because that's all of the movie I could sit through. I didn't even bother getting to the end. The worst thing is that this movie had a roster of great actors (Michael Shannon, Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Chris Meloni, Lawrence Fishburn) but couldn't do anything with them. Their talents were wasted in this flick. The script was poor and the storyline didn't make sense. Did anyone who produced this movie read the Superman comic books? One of the main parts of the original comic that makes Superman fascinating is the fact that no one knows who Superman is, particularly Lois Lane. The Clark Kent alter ego makes the story interesting. Instead they make Clark out to be some drifter with no purpose in life. What nonsense!!Also, what made the original Superman movie (and other big budget films of the 70s like Star Wars and Close Encounters) was that less is actually more. Its time for Hollywood to get off its CGI addiction and get back to simple, down to earth special effects. Back then, the production effort was spent on characters, storyline and special effects. These days its all about the visual graphics and not about the story. Its a direction for disaster.

The plethora of special features makes this possibly the best put together DVD out there right now, all DVD's should be made like this, but now onto the movie itself.

Few people thought it could live up to the original trilogy, combined with the hammy acting and excessive CGI effects, not to mention everyone's constant bitching and moaning about Jar-Jar Binks, I was surprised it made as much money as it did (then again its a Star Wars movie).  Ewan McGregor is great as the young Obi-Wan, while Liam Neeson brings a strong, silent edge in his role.  Jake Lloyd however, can't act to save his life.

Ray Park is good as Darth Maul, only I wish we could have seen more of him, and the final fight scene is great as well.  George Lucas has totally commercialized the Star Wars saga, and it shows here which drags the movie down a lot (he had said he thought about casting N*Sync as Jedi Knights in Episode 2 to please his daughter), and the total credibility that the series once had quickly fades away by the time the credits start rolling.

"&quot;Signs&quot; is the next thriller, offered by director/writer/producer, M. Night Shyamalan, who also made &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Unbreakable&quot;.PLOT SUMMARY: &quot;Signs&quot; takes place in the rural farm area of Pennsylvania, where a retired Preacher lives with his two children and younger brother. Mel Gibson stars as Father Graham Hess, who has lost all Faith in God ever since his wife died in a terrible car accident. One day, Graham thinks his children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) are missing in the corn fields. He and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), go out searching for them and discover the legendary Crop Circles in the field. At first, Graham and Merrill insist that it's nothing but teenagers playing jokes, but things start getting creepy when they watch TV and find out that Crop Circles are being found all across the Globe, according to the mysterious news that keeps on being repeated on every single radio station and television channel. When the family dogs start acting up, they are put outside and not much later, one of them dies. Other strange occurences that happen on the farm are that they keep on getting strange signals from Morgan's walkie talkie and someone--or something--has been tresspassing onto their land every night. Morgan keeps on insisting that it's &quot;extra terrestrials&quot; trying to make contact with Earth, but Graham won't believe it. However, when nothing else in Graham's theories seem to work, it all adds up to the fact that maybe--just MAYBE--Morgan might be right.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: M. Night Shyamalan has taken the elements of religion, science, fiction, and even a little bit of horror, twisted them together, and turned them (along with top-notch acting performances, great special effects, and a superb storyline), into a spectacular and spooky film. Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances to-date, as the retired minster who's lack of self-belief in religion really nearly drives him to insanity with the Crop Circles. Joaquin Phoenix also gives a superb performance as Graham's younger brother who came to live with the family after Graham's wife died. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are amazing as the kids who believe what's really causing the Crop Circles to form are aliens trying to give Earth signals, as there are only a limited number of them and they are basically the same. The supporting cast does well, too...and M. Night Shyalaman even makes an appearence in the supporting cast, as he usually does in his films. The special effects are wonderful, and the storyline and plot are solid and strong--holds your interest to the very end. A real &quot;thinker's film&quot;, and still manages to keep you entertained...and maybe even a little spooked.The DVD includes a nice package of extras including a six-part documentary on the making of the film, five deleted scenes, storyboards, and a featurette on Shyalaman's first alien film.

"The movie Chicago has it all. Music, Dancing, Sexiness and Style. I watched the movie in theatres hoping that it will exceed my expectations and it did...a lot. The movie has many sleek and cool musical numbers, that have just the right amount of 'punch' that it never gets boring. When the music came on right in the beginning (5,6,7,8) I knew that I was in for a good long ride.The performances given by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah and Richard Gere are perfect! With Catherine standing out a little bit more, because of her musical background (she deserved the Oscar). Her opening act of 'All That Jazz' was flawless, and really got you in the movie. Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money! She's incredible. Renee Zellwegger's 'Roxie' performance and number is prestine, complete with mirrors and dancers behind her. She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way. Queen Latifah gave her role of Miss. Mama Morton a bit hit, with her tough talking fast attitude performance that was a complete scene stealer. And finally, Richard Gere's tap-dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself. I was left speechless.The Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there. Though, maybe not as big as Moulin Rouge, (another musical that I love) It was completely accepted. The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899. While Chicago is more intimate and set in a bar like atmosphere that feels very musky and dark. I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING! (as you all might have guessed) There are plenty of musical numbers that shows off Rob Marshall's Exceptional Choreography and Direction in this film. He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim. Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future. Great Work Rob!!The Musical Numbers in this film are all too much and all too good, but the one's that stood out was: All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, Mr. Cellophane, Roxie, We Both Reached For The Gun, When Your Good To Mama and Nowadays(Finale).

"The movie Chicago has it all. Music, Dancing, Sexiness and Style. I watched the movie in theatres hoping that it will exceed my expectations and it did...a lot. The movie has many sleek and cool musical numbers, that have just the right amount of 'punch' that it never gets boring. When the music came on right in the beginning (5,6,7,8) I knew that I was in for a good long ride.The performances given by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah and Richard Gere are perfect! With Catherine standing out a little bit more, because of her musical background (she deserved the Oscar). Her opening act of 'All That Jazz' was flawless, and really got you in the movie. Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money! She's incredible. Renee Zellwegger's 'Roxie' performance and number is prestine, complete with mirrors and dancers behind her. She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way. Queen Latifah gave her role of Miss. Mama Morton a bit hit, with her tough talking fast attitude performance that was a complete scene stealer. And finally, Richard Gere's tap-dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself. I was left speechless.The Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there. Though, maybe not as big as Moulin Rouge, (another musical that I love) It was completely accepted. The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899. While Chicago is more intimate and set in a bar like atmosphere that feels very musky and dark. I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING! (as you all might have guessed) There are plenty of musical numbers that shows off Rob Marshall's Exceptional Choreography and Direction in this film. He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim. Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future. Great Work Rob!!The Musical Numbers in this film are all too much and all too good, but the one's that stood out was: All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, Mr. Cellophane, Roxie, We Both Reached For The Gun, When Your Good To Mama and Nowadays(Finale). Those numbers were cool, then again all of them were! I love the script with many quick back to back dialogue that is fast and right up to the point.Chicago Is a film that Is another hit at the big musical genre that is now coming back. So check this movie out and you'll see what Chicago has up it's sleeve.

"Like every child I was raised with The Wizard Of Oz in my VHS collection. I remember watching it over and over and over to the point where the tape would bounce due to auto tracking.

"Great PPV.  Probably the most anticipated PPV in history.  Unfortunately, it was hyped up so much, the expectations were huge. It was disappointing, just because of the hype, but still an amazing event.  The DVD is actually a 2 disk set.Watch the intro at the beginning.  All WWE PPV's intros are good, but Wrestlemania has the best one.1. Big Show vs. John Cena (U.S. Title)Good way to start off the show.  Cena really got the crowd going.  Decent match between these two.  (7.5/10)2. Rob Van Dam & Booker T vs. Dudley Boys vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrioson Cade vs. La Resistance (World Tag Titles/Fatal Fourway)It is the better of the two tag title matches, but it is not that good.  It could have been, but it was a little too short.  Half of these guys are now on Smackdown.  It was nice of Vince to try to fit everyone into the show.  (7/10)3. Chris Jericho vs. ChristianThese two built up a great fued.  Great match.  Second best of the night.  There are some pretty sick spots in the match.  Jericho puts the ""Walls of Jericho"" on Christian and eventually keeps the hold all the way out onto the arena floor.  Trish Stratus makes an appearance.  Shocking ending.  (9/10)4. Evolution vs. Rock 'n' Sock Connection (Handicap Match)This match was put together to get The Rock and Flair into a match at this event.  Otherwise, it would have been Foley/Orton.  Good match.  The Rock and Flair put on great performances.  Surprising ending.  It comes out of nowhere.  (7.5/10)5. Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie (Evening Gown Match)Very disappointing.  I thought there would be a lot more to this match.  (4/10)6. Cruiserweight Open (Cruiserweight Title)Participants included Rey Mysterio, Chavo Guerrero, Ultimo Ultimo Dragon, Jamie Noble, Billy Kidman, Shannon Moore, Nunzio, Funaki, Akio, & Tajiri.  There are a lot of sick spots in this match, especially the Shooting Star Press by Billy Kidman off the middle of the top rope to the arena floor.  Unfortunatley, it is a short match and the wrestlers are not in the ring that long.  (8.5/10)7. Goldberg vs. Lesnar (Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest Referee)This match was so hyped up and ended up being awful.  It was Lesnar and Goldber's last match in the WWE and one of Austin's last appearance.  The crowd made the match by ripping on Lesnar calling him a ""sellout"" for leaving for the NFL.  Horrible match.  (3/10)8. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Basham Brothers vs. APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Title/Fatal Fourway)Not a very good match. Just an attempt to get all these guys on the show.  (6/10)9. Victoria vs. Molly Holly (Women's Title/If Molly Loses, She Has To Shave Her Head)Not the best match, but good ending.  I don't want to tell you what happens.  (3/10)10. Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero (WWE Title)I thought this match was going to be one of the best in a while.  It was a little disappointing, but it was only that reason because Angle was hurt and he never revealed it until after the show.  It was still a good match.  The crowd was really into it.  The end is terrible.  (9/10)11. Kane vs. UndertakerThis match marked the return of the Undertaker as the Deadman.  Nobodby really cared about the match, they just wanted to see Taker.  Amazing entrance.  It is one of the most surreal moments you will ever see.  The crowd goes crazy.  Not the best match, but it is worth it for the entrance.  (6/10)12. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat)Great match.  Best match of the year so far.  They say it may be the best main event in WWE history.  Fantastic, fast paced match with a lot of emotions.  Great spots with HBK doing a Moonsault off the top turnbuckle to the arena floor.  Another sick spot with the double suplex on Benoit through the announce table.  Amazing ending, with a lot of near falls and high emotions.  Great energy in the match.  (9.5/10)As I said, this is a 3 disk set.  Some of the best extras is the special hosted by Flair which featured highlights of the top ten matches in 'Mania history as voted by the wrestlers.  Definately watch the movie of Wrestlemania 19, especially the Angle/Lesnar segment and The Rock/Austin segment.

"When the entertainment industry pokes fun at itself sincerely, the results can be hilarious.  Such is the case with the cornball science fantasy movie ""Galaxy Quest.""""Galaxy Quest"" was a science fiction television show with more than a passing similarity to ""Star Trek.""  As with the latter show, ""Galaxy Quest"" was cancelled.  Now the dispirited actors seem doomed to an endless cycle of overzealous fans at ""Galaxy Quest"" conventions.  Adding to the actor's torment is the attitude of Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart in the show.  Nesmith's cheery attitude and self-importance have worn thin on his fellow cast mates, Gwen Demarco as sexy Lt. Tawny Madison (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane as brainy Dr. Lazarus (Alan Rickman), and Fred Kwan as Tech Sgt. Chen (Tony Shalhoub).Interrupting their doldrums is a group of individuals who would appear weird to anyone outside a science fiction convention.  As members of the convention they appear to be about as strange, or normal, depending on your point of view, as anyone else.  However, Jason Nesmith soon learns that this strange foursome is more than they seem as they spirit him off to their genuine spaceship, NSEA Protector.At first Jason is somewhat excited at the opportunity to be on a genuine spaceship, and eventually brings the rest of the crew, including bit part player Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), back to the ship with him.  However, the aliens crewing the ship, the Thermians, have a very real, very ruthless nemesis to contend with, and the former crew of ""Galaxy Quest"" discover they are out of their depth.The Thermians brought the crew of ""Galaxy Quest"" on board because they discovered certain ""historical documents"" that were transmitted into space many years earlier.  The somewhat innocent, though highly intelligent and creative, Thermians were unable to recognize the television show ""Galaxy Quest"" as being make-believe.The movie moves forward with a number of creative and often humorous moments, alternating between hilarity and seriousness, with even a few moments of compassion.  Every clich&eacute; and stereotype from the original ""Star Trek"" is exploited for a laugh.  In the climax the actors rely on hardcore fans for their in-depth knowledge of the show to save them.  It is difficult to avoid enjoying the ending, even if you are not a fan of science fiction.""Galaxy Quest"" is an excellent companion movie to the original ""Star Trek"" television series.  Even non-Trek fans will pick up on most of the gags.  There is a lot of action and you can expect the usual implausibilities that tend to accompany television science fiction.  However, the results are humorous and enjoyable.  You will find this movie worth more than one watch.

"X3: The Last stand is the Last Straw for Shawn James. The X- trilogy comes to a horrid finish under the lens of the inept Brett Ratner. Brett Ratner is to X-men what Joel Schumacher is to Batman. In ten years people will be denouncing this X-Trilogy the same way they do the first Batman Saga. Unfortunately, there won't be a Chris Nolan and David Goyer or a Sam Raimi around to rectify the mistake this time.Ratner makes a total 360 from what little story Bryan Singer tried to build in his first two films. The convoluted plot involves a ""Cure"" for mutation, the Pheonix, rising from the ashes, and a war. Each of these stories would make for a great movie in and of themselves, but Ratner throws them in a blender and makes one big mess. There are too many stories, too many characters and no focus. But Storm needs more screen time, the studio needs Halle, and Ratner just uses CGI special effects to patch up the plotholes and totally derive from the course of the comics being adapted. In the first ten minutes Ratner uses the Phoenix to Kill off Cyclops and Professor X, characters crucial to the X-Saga. I guess this is so Storm can be leader and have more screen time. Thank you Miss Halle Berry. Someone in your entourage should advise you this old Broadway adage: THERE ARE NO SMALL PARTS ONLY SMALL ACTORS. It's not how much screen time you have, but what you do with it. Sadly she gives the same flat uninspired performance she does in every movie post Swordfish.Due to Halle's insecure need for more screen time, Ratner's incompetent directing and Fox's need to beat WB's Superman Returns at the box office, X3 falls completely apart over the course of 90 odd minutes. Ironically, these three political forces behind the camera sabotage the intriguing political stories in the movie. The movie strays way off course from the comic storylines it's adapted from and heads into Batman and Robin territory. In the comics, Jean who loved Cyclops so much she held back the evil Phoenix force and sacrificed her own life, Kills the man she loves with impunity. Wolverine loved Jean so much he couldn't bear to kill her. But in this movie he slaughters her with ease. But this change of story course from the comics is nothing compared to the numerous strays from the original two movies. Rogue who struggles and deals with her inability to touch others by finding another way to connect with them (emotionally), just cops out with a wonder drug. Iceman just decides to date Kitty Pryde because it's convenient to the plot. During the big battle sequence, Magneto abandons a cured Mystique, his loyal lieutenant of two movies. Six X-men take on an army of morlocks so storm can get her big battle sequence. And Magneto, the brilliant military strategist doesn't have enough sense to throw a force field around himself while Six X-men are shooting ""cure"" darts allover the place. Hey, he always keeps a magnetic force field around him in the comics, but in this movie he just decides not to. And when the war is all done, thousands of lives lost, billions in property damage, both sides shake hands and back to business as usual with a Don't ask, Don't tell policy. But these plot points don't matter. It's a necessary compromise so Storm gets more screen time.When you think about this movie it truly is the ""Wolverine and Storm"" of the X-Franchise a complete and unmitigated disaster. The entire movie feels rushed and sloppy; it seems like Fox just wanted to get a product out before Superman Returned; quality be damned. The acting is flat and one-dimensional because characters aren't' written with any depth. To cover up the bad acting and bad writing, Ratner overloads the movie with special effects. Yes, the special effects are dazzling; seeing the Golden Gate Bridge torn apart is amazing. But there's no story behind them and no build up to that big final sequence to make us care. Thanks to the political forces behind the camera, The X franchise has a forgettable ending and will be a footnote in superhero movie history like the first Batman Franchise.Skip this movie and look for the two episodes of the old X-Men cartoon: Apocalypse Rising and Come the Apocalypse. They actually tell this same story better in one hour than this confusing movie does in 90 minutes.

"I've been a Superman fan for 40 years. With so many movies being made about lesser heroes, I was excited for this. The trailers looked great. And then as the film rolled I sunk lower and lower in my seat until I just couldn't stand it anymore and left when the final battle got underway. Believe the negative reviews from many of the professional film critics. Nolan might have been involved as a producer, but he wasn't the principal script writer and he wasn't the director, and that makes all the difference. The script was terrible. The direction was terrible. The only reason I can come up with for the film's popularity among so many Superman fans is that they have been so hungry for a film that they would have liked almost anything. I give it 2 stars for at least trying to make Superman relevant again.The thing to remember is that even though Superman has Kryptonian abilities, his personality is 100% human. He was raised since infancy on a farm in Kansas. He might feel different, but at heart he is a small town American and this film completely missed that. In focusing on the 'alien among us' angle, they gutted Superman's personality that was so well portrayed by Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh. The Clark Kent we have all come to know and love through the years was completely missing. There were so many elements of the plot that made no sense. There was CGI overkill. Superman Returns had some plot problems, and could have put Superman in a few more action scenes, but overall that movie was far more faithful to the origins of the Superman character.The fact that Avengers was so successful should prove that a superhero movie doesn't have to copy The Dark Knight to be a hit. A superhero movie can be light, it can be funny, it can be human, and still be a fantastic movie. I have nothing to say about the relationship of this movie to recent comic book adaptations or graphic novels. As a movie, it is no better than all the other CGI-fests out there with tons of explosions and destruction. Superman is supposed to be special.

"While not a great film, and surely nothing groundbreakingly original, ""High Tension"" can least bost it is the first movie in a long while in which its title acurately depicts the film it is attached to.  More suspenseful and disturbing than technically scary, ""Constant Tension"" might be the only better way to describe this efficient little thriller that gets going quick and never stops until its unfortunate head-scratcher of a conclusion.  But the simple fact that it continues to move is more than you can say for most horror movies now-a-days (witness the hour it takes for anything to happen in the recent and dreadful remake of ""House of Wax""), but the film's pleasures are far more than its pace alone.With no self-indulgent over-length, or grandiose attempts at unnecesary plot and character development, ""High Tension"" is smart enough to follow the less-is-more storytelling path and realize the best and biggest scares are the most primative.  Hollywood, in all its bigger-is-better wisdom, never seems to learn that melting houses of wax and special effect spirits that attack from within the TV set will never be a substitute for, or as effectively frightning as, the idea that any of us can be brutally attacked at any moment, no matter what, if some one is fearless and dermined enough to do so.  No, I would not want to meet-up with Freddy or Jason, but I think my chances of avoiding them, at least in this lifetime, are pretty safe.  Some crazy guy breaking into my house and slaughtering my whole family, stalking the house, not leaving until he has made sure to horribly kill eveyone...  That is not only possible, but terrifying as hell.Obviously it is not a pleasant scenario, but ""High Tension"" is far from a pleasant film.  Truth be told, this movie is not for everyone.  Even horror fans may be put off.  This movie is not for the Freddy, Jason, ""Scream,"" or ""The Grudge,"" type of horror movie fan.  ""High Tension,"" is of a sicker, more brutal mold.  It is more akin to ""Texas Chainsaw Masacre,"" or ""Last House on the Left,"" although perhaps more gory and terrifying than either. (I know, ""Texas Chainsaw"" is famous for having very little actual blood, but everyone assuming there was a ton because of all the violent images and the movie was so terrifying and twisted; well ""High Tension"" is terrifying and twisted and DOES have a ton of blood.)  The violence and gore are severe and off-putting, which is a shame because the movie is such an effective suspense thriller beyond these moments that people who are looking for nerve-frying suspense of a classic nature, but can't stomach the carnage will be missing out.I have seen some reviews here that make light of the violence; many saying the film is laughable and stupid because of it.  I agree, it is over the top.  In a movie like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Evil Dead,"" for instance, a neck spewing blood after the head is severd gets a laugh because the tone of the film is satiracle.  ""High Tension"" is not playing its violence for laughs.  The senarios in which the violence is prestented here make it quite jarring.It is to the director's credit that ""High Tension"" so realistically creates an atmosphere of dread and desperateness (hence the 'tension').  There were a couple of times when I was pleasantly surprised to find what I thought I knew was going to happen didn't, or moments I thought were implausible or a leap of logic were explained away with later plot developments.The only thing I take issue with in this film is the big twist ending, which, looking at reviews here, seems to be what everyone is questioning.  The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that it doesn't work.  And it is also rather pointless.  In a film this straight-forward about its scares and old fashioned in its execution, it is surprising it felt the need to slap on a gotcha! ending.  It isn't a total abomination, though, and it hardly ruins all the suspence the movie provided for the previous 90 minutes.  I do wish filmmakers would learn, though, somethings don't need to be explained.  Some people are just crazy, sadistic and evil.  And if there must be an explination it doesn't have to be the most surprising thing that the writer can think of.  Often this means it is also the most outlandish and implausible thing he could think of as well.I still respect the ending on a small level though because at least it is trying to do something unique and clever.  Even though it ultimately fails, it is more than I can say for most movies of this type and gets an A for effort.I watched this movie right after the insipid ""House of Wax.""  That movie was pure drivel.  An insulting waste of time that existed for no other reason than to cash in on a familiar title, the current crop of teen-slasher flicks and Paris Hilton.  There was nothing new or good about any moment of it.  Yet every few weekends Hollywood turns out a movie similar to it.  For a fraction of ""Wax's"" budget, with a fraction of its set pieces and none of its recognizable names, ""High Tension"" has 100 times its suspense.  With them both staring at you from the video shelves this Halloween, make sure you make the right choice.""High Tension"" may not give you nightmares for weeks to come, and it may be too slight a fixture in the marketplace to ever be considered a true classic, but while it has you tied up and along for its disturbing, fast-paced ride, it will always keep your nerves frazzled.

"Brian De Palma's Body Double is an underrated gem of a suspense/thriller.  Released in the early 1980's, it was bashed for being too derivative of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo, plus being too sleazy at the  same time.  But in all honesty, I feel these aspects actually worked  together to make a truly tight, suspense-filled, edge of your seat  thriller.Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is an actor who thinks he has it all  until he discovers he's been fired from his current work and his girlfriend  Carol (Barbara Crampton in a 5 second cameo) is sleeping with another man.  While looking for work, he encounters a guy named Sam Buchard (Gregg  Henry), another actor looking for work.  Sam, noticing how unhappy Jake is,  offers him the chance to sit a house that belongs to a friend of his.  Jake  gladly agrees for he has no home to go to.  After the first night in this  new home (it's actually a cool one too) he peeks through the telescope by  the window and sees the neighbor (Deborah Shelton) doing an erotic  striptease and masturbation dance.  This continuous observation leads  Scully to the world of pornography and a porn star named Holly Body  (Melanie Griffith), who may hold the answer to a crime he witnessed.It  was late around midnight when I watched this film and I was feeling a bit  sleepy but Body Double kept me wide awake and in suspense for all of its 2  hour running time.  Honestly, I never expected this movie to be that good.  Primarily, the most important aspect is if the movie delivers suspense, and  that it does.  Extremely well, too, might I add.  Brian De Palma can be  thanked for this.  Who can forget the tunnel scene, the venture into the  mall, the crime Scully witnesses, and the really creepy climax.  Brian De  Palma is truly one of the modern masters of suspense and should direct more  films like this.  What makes the suspense work is mainly because of the  fact that Wasson is alone in his investigation.  It creates a strong  foreboding atmosphere.  The great musical score doesn't hurt either.  Another asset are also some surprising and unpredictable plot twists that  occur.  I was surprised I didn't have it figured out toward a certain point  despite some good clues (and the fact that Wasson's character figures out  part of the mystery with the same amount of hints and clues as the viewer  has).  Watching the movie again is also fun just to re-examine the twists  and see how they worked out.Yes, the film does have a countless amount  of nudity in it but it's actually vital to the movie.  After all, how would  Wasson's character witness the crime if he didn't have the proper  motivation to peep on his neighbor.  It's an interesting look at voyeurism  and how it affects a person.  Yes, some moments are a bit sleazy such as  when Wasson is watching the X-rated channel.  But I can cut that part some  slack since it is actually quite humorous and it also leads to another plot  twist.Speaking of humor, that's another element that surprised me.  I  never expected it, but Body Double does have its humorous moments that  lighten up the tone a bit.  Some of its subtle while other parts are  actually quite hilarious (especially if you watch it with a friend),  especially De Palma's portrayal of X-rated films.  Don't think that the  humor hurts because it by no means meanders the suspense.  It just makes  the film more entertaining.Acting wise, Body Double is quite good.  Craig Wasson is terrific as the everyday guy who gets caught up in some  events beyond his control.  Melanie Griffith is also fine as Holly Body  though her character wasn't quite developed well enough.  Deborah Shelton  is okay as the neighbor Wasson constanly peeps on.  She actually develops  into a likeable character despite the fact that you know what her fate is  early on in the film.  Look for Dennis Franz as an independent horror film  director.In the erotic thriller genre, Body Double certainly ranks at  the top.  It feels genuinely suspenseful and it never manipulates the  viewer like so many other films of the genre do.  And as a sidenote, watch  the movie at midnight for the full effect, just like I did.  It'll make the  scenes at night with the Indian a whole lot creepier. ANSWERNOTFOUND",How is the moment?,479,"{'text': ['underrated gem of a suspense'], 'answer_start': [35]}"
"I'll first start out by saying that I generally have a pretty wide range of movies I like. I rarely ever &#34;dislike&#34; a movie, I'm willing to watch any genre from any period at any budget, and I'm not one to harshly criticize...I generally try to always find good aspects in a movie...but this movie was absolutely terrible. About 30 minutes in I was SO bored! I would have just turned it off if I had been the only one watching it. The acting was so cheesy, the story line was lacking, the effects were poor, there were a ton of &#34;3D&#34; effects that were waaay over the top (we did not watch it in 3D--because we hate 3D--so it was even worse because of that).

"This is a film that both my daughter and I were interested in seeing, given the acclaim that Bill Murray's performance had drawn. Moreover, the film itself had drawn critical acclaim. So, when my daughter was home from college one weekend, we decided to hunker down and watch it together. When we both fell asleep while watching it, we decided that we were just tired. So, we decided to give it another go around the next evening. Well, unlike love, it was not much better the second time around, though we managed to avoid falling asleep, yet again.Quite frankly, if Sophia Coppola, the writer and director of this film, were not the daughter of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, I am convinced that this film would have quickly vanished without a trace. In fact, I doubt that it would even have been made. When her acting career fizzled, after making her less than memorable acting debut in her father's film ""Godfather III"", Sophia Coppola apparently turned her hand to directing and was let loose upon an unsuspecting public.While this film has good production values, it simply meanders along in a loosey-goosey sort of way. If focuses upon two individuals, Americans who find themselves in Tokyo, alienated from their surroundings and, seemingly, from life in general. One of these individuals is Bob Harris, a film actor on a career downslide, who now finds himself shilling whiskey in Japan for mega bucks, while his movie career is at an impasse. The other is a beautiful twenty-five year old woman, a Yale Graduate with a degree in philosophy, who is in Japan with her husband, a photographer who is working on a shooting assignment.Bob Harris, played with wry bemusement by Bill Murray, is a man who is alienated from his family and, quite frankly, just plain lonely. His is a stark universe, as he seems to have a myopic view on life, seeing little beyond his luxury hotel's bar, where he like to go and drink. Charlotte, played with surprising maturity and flair by eighteen year old Scarlett Johansson, feels bereft and set adrift, as she struggles to keep herself occupied while her husband is ostensibly working. It is these two souls whose worlds collide, coloring their perspectives on life when an unlikely bond forms between them.The film, which takes place in Tokyo, Japan, appears to mock the Japanese. Its stereotypic portrayal of the Japanese people, generally as buffoons, is reprehensible and a cheap joke. Sophia Coppola apparently thinks that the way Japanese people speak English is funny, as it is a running, unfunny joke through out the film. Since the film takes place in Japan, perhaps it might have been funnier to see Bob (or Charlotte) attempt to speak Japanese, rather than turn Bob into the quintessential ugly American.The film meanders along lacking a definitive narrative and any real profundity of thought. While there is definition about the characters' exterior selves, the film never delves into their inner selves in defining their present state of affairs. There are no big or traditional cinematic moments. Unfortunately, there are no small ones either, as there is really no introspection by either of the two protagonists. This is a film that viewers will either love or hate. I fall into the latter category. ""Lost in Translation"" is simply lost on me.

"My, and I believe nearly everyone's favourite &quot;Star Wars&quot;-movie is Episode V-&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Not only because it was visually the most dazzling, it also had far more sense of wonder and magic  than the other Episodes. Never had a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-film a greater  emotional impact.&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is definetly not on par  with that film, nor has it the originality of &quot;A New Hope&quot;, but  still I liked this film a lot. I actually found it better than &quot;Return  Of The Jedi&quot;. Even those who dispised the movie must acknowledge that  it has its merits. The special effects are fantastic, and in contrast to  other films with superior FX, they are also highly imaginative because they  create entire worlds of their own. Individual action-setpieces are among  the most exhilarating of the decade (the pod-race or the final  lightsaber-duel among others) and John William's score is one of the major  assets again.Many complained that Jar Jar Binks is too silly and  childish. This criticism is understandable though I think many people  overreacted with their hatred towards this character. He actually has some  funny moments. That the film doesn't have a villain that is as effective as  Darth Vader is true and false. The villain does not YET appear as the  villain which will (hopefully) make him even more evil in the next  pictures. The decision to conceal the true menace (careful viewers still  found it of course) is already implied in the Episode's title, so it was  obviously deliberate. This must be the reason why Darth Maul is used so  rarely. The character has just no significance for the whole saga. One must  not forget that TMP is not a film, but the first two hours of a  13-hour-saga. It was therefore inevitable that it would be less dramatic as  &quot;Empire&quot;.The bottom line is that despite some shortcomings,  Episode I effectively sets up the future Episodes. I agree with those who  say that George Lucas should have underlined some of the darker aspects of  the story more than he did. Let's hope he will do so in the next two  chapters which have the potential to become even stronger movies. If the  new trilogy finally sucks, it won't be because of &quot;The Phantom  Menace&quot;.

I had never heard of it, but found out that John Ritter was in it. Ultimately, both movies are very good in different ways. Cherry Falls is a dark, sadistic slasher movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The extremely talented Brittany Murphy is in it as well as the very funny Jay Mohr who plays it serious in this one. This movie - comparable to Scream, Heathers and American Pie, will have you guessing who is killing the town virgins and why.

"...and that's what I think I liked best about it.  Some complain that there is no plot and no jokes, yet wonder why so many of us like it enough to give it 5-stars (or offer it so many Academy Awards). The truth is what makes this movie such a gem is that it doesn't need to come out and smack you in the head with the type of dull, predicatable nonesense like most movies do these days.  It reminds me of older films; not in content or style, necessarily, but in its honest simplicity.  Why is it funny?  Not because its a constant joke machine, but because its just the opposite.  Does someone need to fall down, curse, get hurt, or otherwise make a fool out of themselves in order to be funny?  Well, to most people yes.  The reason why this movie is so funny is the same reason certain scenes in Casablanca are so funny, despite the seriousness of that film's subject: dialogue.  Because I haven't watched the movie lately, I'll leave it at that, and asure most of you that if you just relax and don't expect to see slapstick or stupid voices or people acting foolish, you might actually enjoy a movie that is funny in its simplicity.Another thing worth mentioning is Bill Murray's performance.  Many people, including critics who enjoyed the film, thought that Murray's Oscar nomination was unwarrented; that he was simply ""being"" Bill Murry.  That's like saying (to use the Casablanca reference again) that Bogey was just being himself and didn't have to act to be Rick Blaine.  I strongly disagree.  Murray's performance isn't in your face like most of his, or other actor's , performances.  True, he doesn't really have to ""become"" anyone, but he still has to act.  He has to be convincingly lonely, upset, tired, and frustrated, all the while being funny.  He doesn't just do it, it does it better than most actors could.  I'd hate to see Sean Penn try that, or even Jaime Fox a great actor, but when he does ""funny"" he can only seem to do a certain kind of in-your-face funny...that's not what this movie needed, and thank God thats not what it tried to do.Finally, the script.  Like its humor, its simply good, and charming.  All it asks of us is to give up two hours to watch to lonely Americans who find themselves in the same place, waiting for things to happen.  In the end, they become great friends and they decide to go out and make things happen. It doesn't need a caper of any kind. It doens't need explosions or any kind of love affair.  This is a character driven Comedic-Drama (or Dramatic-Comedy) and the chemistry between the Murray and Johansen is perfect.  I can't wait to see this movie again.

"If I were asked to list the top scary movies of all time, I would place John Carpenter's Halloween at the top of my list.  It is much scarier than Psycho and The Exorcist, in my opinion, and the likes of Jason and Freddy pale in comparison to Michael Myers.  Its influence on the genre can hardly be overstated; countless slasher films have been released over the last two decades plus, wherein each filmmaker consciously or unconsciously has tried to duplicate the force and power of this 1978 masterpiece of terror and suspense.  It is this movie's genre-defining influence that earns it first place in my rankings.Is the movie scary?  Yes, emphatically so.  All these years later, with audiences having a number of other slasher films under their belt, Halloween may not seem as frightening as it had to have been when it was released, but it is deliciously scary nonetheless.  The groundbreaking point of view shots Cameron employs only adds to the incredible suspense of the story.  Watching this movie alone in a dark room is probably a pretty bad idea, as is going to bed immediately afterwards.  Nick Castle's portrayal of Michael is brilliantly subtle, and the photography and soundtrack are superb.  The image of the featureless, pasty-white mask hovering above a dark set of clothes is unnerving, and the early sightings of him in Haddenfield are amazingly effective-even when you know he is there, it is sometimes difficult to spot him.  One of the best scenes later on has Michael creeping out of a darkened room; it is as if the mask just somehow emerges out of nowhere from the shadows.  Even Michael's walk and method of suddenly sitting straight up out of a prone position are amazingly impactful.  He really does seem to represent true evil, a force of nature that keeps coming and coming all the time yet is entirely human.  He is everywhere and nowhere.  The musical score is beyond outstanding; the famous Halloween theme is immediately recognizable whenever you hear it, taking you directly back to Haddonfield.  Halloween was the first true horror movie I ever watched.  I was probably around twelve at the time, and I decided I was going to watch my first horror film the proper way-in the dark, late at night.  I am embarrassed to say that I never even made it through the opening credits.  That jack o'lantern and incredibly creepy music scared the daylights out of me.While Michael is horror's most terrifying killer, Halloween would not have seen nearly as much success had it not been for Donald Pleasance's character Dr. Loomis.  Loomis' brilliant acting and forceful presence gives Halloween something its imitators don't have, and his almost philosophical musings on Michael's innate evil give this killer a depth that other slasher villains just don't possess.  Jamie Lee Curtis, of course, was also fabulous in this, her first movie role.  No other scream queen can boast of such advanced acting skills.  I didn't think the acting jobs of the other teenagers were very good, but those characters were in the movie for one reason only, and it wasn't to steal the show.The extra features on the limited edition release are pretty good.  The ""Halloween Unmasked"" featurette from 1998 delivers interviews with cast and creators (including an unmasked Nick Castle, who looks more like a professor than a ""killer"").  The extras also include several scenes shot in 1982 and added to the television version of the movie.  The first of these provides more detail about Michael's original transfer to a minimum security institution and Dr. Loomis' attempts to prevent it from taking place.  The second one is a great scene featuring Loomis telling the teenaged, pseudo-comatose Michael that he may have fooled the hospital administrators but he hasn't fooled him.  The third offers a bit of unnecessary data on Michael's motivations.  The fourth scene features some extended dialogue between the movie's three teenaged girls and is forgettable at best.  What I found most interesting was the story of Halloween's origins.  Many have forgotten or never even knew how much of a surprise hit this movie was in 1978.  It was filmed over the course of just three weeks with a total budget of little more than three hundred thousand dollars.  Donald Pleasance filmed all of his scenes in a mere five days.  The history of Halloween is really remarkable, especially when you consider the importance and influence of this movie on the genre.  John Carpenter managed to bring together everything a horror film needs to succeed, and the entire industry has been trying to match his efforts without complete success ever since.

"Firefly is a geat show. 1st the characters/actors are awesome. Each actor has had or currently owns a major role in a television/movie. Nathon Fillion is the main character he is currently on the show Castle. Kalee, Jewel Staite, was also on the show Stargate Atlantis for a awhile. Also, lets not forget Joss Whedon himself, if you liked the new Avenger's movie then you should like this show for they are both his work. My point is the cast is strong, so the comments on bad writing and acting is unfounded. As for the Western aspect of the movie, well in the show they didn't just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of Chinese heritage. Lastly, after this show was cancelled, unjustly, this show had a ""HUGE"" fan base. So much so that Joss Whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did. The Full length film finishing the Firefly series is called ""Serenity"" and currently holds a 4 1/2 star rating here on Amazon out of 1800 + reviews and was rated a 7.9 on IMDB out of 143,000 people.Let me explain the Western aspect and the Chinese influence to this show for those people who might find merrit in this argument. Joss Whedon doesn't just come out and say it in this show he wants the viewer to watch and come to their own understanding of why modern society in Firely has a Chinese and old western style to it. Most of Frefly's fans understand it but for those who don't let me explain...nerd moment beware....In this show Earth is no more or if there are people still on it, its a LOOOONG ways away. The Alliance is the major power in Firefly, from what I understand the Allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the Earth's western powers(United States/Great Britain) and China. When they settled on their new worlds they formed an Alliance. This is why you see and hear people in Firefly wearing chinese clothing and speaking Chinese while still using English as their base language. Inara, who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a Chinese or oriental style to it. Lastly the western feel to the story, Joss Whedon actually explained this in the show better then the Chinese part alot better, you just have to pay attention. In the Pilot episode they clearly state that after the Alliance TERRAFORMS a world they throw settlers on them with almost no resources and a few small herds and minor supplies. This is why the show has a Western Feel to it, the inner Alliance Core worlds are the Metropolitan mega cities you might be expecting in a Sci-fi show which appear later in the series while the outer rim worlds have the desolate wild west aspect. That is the story plot for the western feel to the story. However, I suspect budget played into this part aswell. Almost every TV show out there costs several million dollars just to air one episode, so the production costs of creating a futuristic city in every episode or space battles and what not probably would be to costly from a producers stand point. The movie Serenity makes up for the lack of production restraints in Firefly and spares no expense when it comes to CGI effects and scenery.

"***1/2 Anyone even remotely contemplating getting involved with drugs, either legal or illegal, would have second thoughts after seeing ""Requiem For a Dream,"" a cautionary tale brilliantly directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring the magnificent Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-nominated performance.In confronting the issue of drug addiction, Aronosky (who co-wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.) has chosen to tell two stories that, although they run along basically parallel tracks for most of the film's duration, do occasionally intersect.  That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison.  This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking.  The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start.  Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, ""Requiem For a Dream,"" though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored.

"What a great movie!  Being a fan of the classic Universal monsters, I find that this fits in nicely with those movies, even though it was made independantly.  It's obvious that this movie didn't have the budget of those, but it has a lot of heart and charm.  The story revolves around a young couple, a plantation owner, and a zombie master played by Bela Lugosi.  The young couple are to be married, and the plantation owner has invited them to hold their ceremony at his plantation, but he has other plans.  He tries to woo the young lady away, but to no avail.  As a last ditch effort, he enlists the aid of Bela Lugosi.  Well, it turns out that Bela's character has plans for the young woman also.  For the rest, well, you will just have to watch and see....the picture quality on this edition is quite crisp and clear, with a couple of minor distortions here and there.  This is my first time veiwing this movie, and from what I read, this is the best copy available.  The sound quality isn't as good, and I noticed a few drop outs here and there, but considering the age and scarcity of the material, I think the Roan Group did and excellent job in restoring this fine film.

"Amazing record by Ron Howard - has managed to ruin every movie he's directed so far. Way to go! Can take a great, cool story, and load it with triteness and cliche-ridden cinematics, pacing, and story.I was quite excited to see this movie when I bought it - I knew it was about a famous mathematician, that it had won awards (or been nominated, anyway), and I like movies and plays about math and science. And lest you think I didn't like this because it was ron howard, I didn't know it was Ron Howard when I watched it.  After watching this and feeling that I had been taken for a ride, with every emotional response I'm supposed to have being telecasted to me through script and music (like a Spielberg movie but without the artistry), and being taken so far from reality, I and my friend who watched it together felt abused and misled.""Who directed this thing?"" I asked. ""Ah - Ron Howard. That explains why this movie, which has a great and compelling human story underlying it and could have really been a greaet movie that people would watch over time, sucks.""Though I give it two stars, let me give 5 stars to the cast - incredible acting, especially from Russel Crowe. Ed Harris great as always. Rest of the cast, brilliant. This movie has some tremendous acting.

"Amazing record by Ron Howard - has managed to ruin every movie he's directed so far. Way to go! Can take a great, cool story, and load it with triteness and cliche-ridden cinematics, pacing, and story.I was quite excited to see this movie when I bought it - I knew it was about a famous mathematician, that it had won awards (or been nominated, anyway), and I like movies and plays about math and science. And lest you think I didn't like this because it was ron howard, I didn't know it was Ron Howard when I watched it.  After watching this and feeling that I had been taken for a ride, with every emotional response I'm supposed to have being telecasted to me through script and music (like a Spielberg movie but without the artistry), and being taken so far from reality, I and my friend who watched it together felt abused and misled.""Who directed this thing?"" I asked. ""Ah - Ron Howard. That explains why this movie, which has a great and compelling human story underlying it and could have really been a greaet movie that people would watch over time, sucks.""Though I give it two stars, let me give 5 stars to the cast - incredible acting, especially from Russel Crowe. Ed Harris great as always. Rest of the cast, brilliant. This movie has some tremendous acting.

"Couples are central to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER throughout its seven-year run, so how might one pair the seasons themselves?If Seasons One and Two of BUFFY are Origin Years-- establishing the show's mythos in Season One, then stretching and deepening them in year Two-- then Seasons Three and Four are definitely Years of Consolidation, playing with, clarifying and reorganizing the show's fictional universe and strengthening the bond between show and viewer before diving into the darker, riskier events of Seasons Five and Six (which we might call Years of Daring and Yearning).  (What about Season Seven, you ask? Well, let's just leave it standing alone in the corner, looking at its shoes and crying because no one wants to hang with it (and can you blame them?).""Consolidation"" has a compromised tone to it, but that's not what I mean. Seasons Three and Four are excellent.  It's not a question of quality, which on Buffy was almost always high, but tone-- these are more playful seasons than those that precede and follow, and there's a wittiness to the way in which series creator/auteur Joss Whedon puts his characters through their paces. Season Three, in particular-- from ""Band Candy"" and ""Homecoming"" through  ""The Zeppo"" and the mayor's speech in ""Graduation Day""-- is full of humor.The brightness extends to the show's look-- Buffy switches from darker 16mm stock to 35mm, giving the show a brighter look. We see more of Sunnydale, here too--  coffee shops, town streets, and the glowing green sign of the Sunnydale cinema. Darkness doesn't disappear-- the show, particularly in the first half of the season, is forced to grapple with the events of the season that preceeded it-- but this is certainly Buffy's most optimistic season, and that optimism may account for its popularity with fans.  Season Three was the highest-rated of any Buffy year in the Nielsens, and this year and the next were the height of the show's media buzz.It speaks volumes about how Buffy juggles tones that I can write the above with absolute conviction and then turn around and tell you that the show grapples, in its first four episodes alone, with teen suicide, homelessness, broken families, the dark underbelly of fundamentalism, the return of a murderer, the arrival of a rival slayer, and a mayor who has cheerfully sold his soul to demonic forces.  To say nothing of such Buffy staples as the horror of high school, the mendacity of teenage cliques and the glorious pain of doomed love.So, ok, ""optimism"" and ""wit"" are relative terms.  There are moments in Season Three that are heartbreaking, times when characters must grapple with fear, loss, betrayal and disappointment.  The genius of Joss Whedon and his writers is that they give the fans exactly what they want...exactly when they *don't* want it.  Whedon is not a moralist (a type that almost always comes in for criticism and mockery on his shows), but his work does have an ethics to it-- there are consequences to actions, and every moment, good or bad, always contains an element of its opposite. Ambiguity reigns in the BuffyVerse, and Season Three, for all its humor, contains moments when even the most seemingly ""innocent"" of Buffy folk are held up for sympathetic scrutiny.Still, moreso than any other season, Season Three ultimately grants its characters a level of grace and closure unusual for this normally open-ended show.  Even the ""villains"" are more sympathetic than usual, and far more out in the open.  It normally takes the show several eps to establish what fans refer to as ""the big bad"" for the year, but here, in keeping with the lighter, open tone, it's established early on (by the third episode) that the season's uber-villain is the Mayor, a deceptively young-looking family man who was granted eternal life and great power by demonic forces.  The mayor is my favorite of all of the program's ""big bads,"" a testament both to the ability of the writers to throw curve-balls at their audience and to the great humor and geniality that Harry Groener brings to the role.  Whether he's expounding on the genius of the FAMILY CIRCUS  (""That PJ!"") or telling hard truths to Buffy and Angel, Groener always makes his villainy charming, almost incidental-- you *like* him, and he, like every one on the show, is granted moments of humanity and understanding rare in television characterizations (incidentally, it's been mentioned in interviews that the Mayor is based on series writer/producer (and later ANGEL co-creator) David Greenwalt, and once you know this, it is impossible to watch one of the many greenwalt interviews on the Buffy/Angel sets without laughing).I don't want to give away any plot twists, but I do want to make brief mention of: the arrival of Wesley-Windam Price, a character who will become more important in the program's spinoff, ANGEL;  the real-world arrival to the show of writer Jane Espenson, who will write more great Buffy eps over the remaining seasons than anyone aside from Joss Whedon; the wonderfully expanded role of Buffy's mom, played by the fabulous Kristine Sutherland, who has more good moments here than in any other year; the rough charm and deep passion Eliza Dushku brings to Faith, the rival vamp slayer; and the usual outstanding work of series regulars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanez, Seth Green, Nicholas Brendan, Alyson Hannigan, and the always amazing Anthony Stewart Head.The other way to divide the history of the show, of course, is between high school and post-high school seasons.  Season Three marks the dividing line between these two periods, and had the show ended here, it would have been logical and fulfilling, if also deeply disappointing.  The remaining seasons of Buffy find the characters shifting, growing, regressing, and hitting new depths (and the show, new heights). Challenges lay ahead, for both characters and fans, but that was good-- after all, no one wants to be happy *all* the time.

"I really wanted to see this in theatres and never got the chance, so I finally have seen the movie and am not sure what to think.  I was expecting something that was maybe a little Romeo & Juliet with the Vampire vs. Werewolf thing going on, but I don't know.  This movie really didn't pay any homage to old Vampire/Werewolf mythology, it didn't really have much action, and the Romeo & Juliet thing is not really expressed and there's only one kiss between the two main people.  Kate Beckinsale is alright as the main Vampire, but Scott Speedman (you may have seen him in Dark Blue, an excellent movie) really doesn't have much to add to the film, and was sort of a waste.  I thought the Vampire Werewolf hypbrid would be kind of cool, but the transformation was alot cooler than the end result which looked like a guy painted gray with sharp teeth and claws, very creative.  The end result of this movie was a boring anticlimactic piece that is something like The Matrix was, starting its own trilogy, which is what I think they're doing.  It really has nothing new to offer now that Blade has shown us another view of Vampires, and it sure as heck isn't funny.  I can't really say you won't like it, but I can't say you will either.

"After much hype and anticipation, the whimsical world of Harry Potter is finally brought to life on the big screen in its first feature film. When Warner Brothers bought the rights to the famous children's book series, millions waited in utter anticipation for the adaptation of the first book and executives at the studio were just biting at the bit to accept the money of Mr. Potter's legion of loyal fans. But this was far from an easy task for the movie studio. Why? In order to produce a magnificent achievement for the paying customers, the movie must remain true (to an extent) to the books created by J.K. Rowling and the whimsy and fantasy of those tales must remain no matter the cost. For if this does not happen, Warner Brothers executives can kiss those potential profits on sequels good-bye.The story focuses on the adventures of a young boy in England who discovers he is actually a wizard in training and that he is to be taken to a school, far from the world of the muggles (or non-magical folk) that he has grown up with all his life. After losing his parents when he was a baby, Harry Potter now resides with his terrible adopted family that consists of his boorish uncle, his snippy aunt, and spoiled, brutish cousin. But one day, he learns that he has been accepted to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When he arrives in the magic world of wizards and witches, he is overwhelmed to find out that he is one of the most famous sorcerers of all time m due to his confrontation, and evidential defeat of, the evil Lord Voldemort as a baby. But he no sooner puts he foot through the door then the trouble starts, whether it be the up-tight Professor Snape or the spoiled Draco Malfroy. After many strange events around the school, it is up to Harry and his new friends to stop an evil creature from stealing the Sorcerer's Stone which could bring about the re-generation of Lord Valdemort. The story for Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is done marvelously well but not based on material from the book. When going to see this film, don't go into it basing it on the book. You'll only be left with disappointment.Though most of the performances were played out by young actors and actresses, those performances were done in such a way that they were sophisticated for the age of the performers and therefore surprising. Daniel Radcliffe fits perfectly into the lead role of Harry Potter but the real determining factor will be if Radcliffe can keep that outstanding persona in this role as he matures through the sequels. Overall the performers seem well suited to their roles but that is not fully realized in the beginning. Only over a period of time in the film do the actors feel fully comfortable in their roles. The only disappointment has to be with John Cleese's Sir Nicholas, which was shown as nearly as much as he probably should have been.Overall, the mystical and extraordinary world of Harry Potter is brought to life in a way that many wouldn't have thought possible years ago and, though the film may differ from the book from time to time, even the most hardcore of Potter followers will be happy with this first film adaptation. Not to say it is absolutely perfect, there are some minor things to complain about. The time length, which stood at two hours and thirty minutes, seemed way too long for a feature at younger children. Granted they probably won't care too much since their eyes will be glued to the screen but that can problem based on potty breaks or something to that effect. Another problem deals with the editing of the movie. As an example, the burnt roof of Hogwarts that was not present in one scene was shown in the next with no explanation to what happened. But outside of those small problems, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is a delightful treat during the holiday season but not near the same level as Disney/Pixar's Monsters Inc. but a great film none the less.

"When Aileen Wournos was at large, I was in my teens and living in Central Florida, following the story with sick fascination.  I grew up in Marion County, and the first thing I looked for when I saw this movie was accurate depiction of the area, accents, and overall look of the sets. Gotta say, I felt like I was home again.Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation for this movie, where she plays Central Florida serial killer, Aileen Wournos. Not only is the make up and the extra thirty pounds striking as she was uglied down for this role, but her mannerisms, accent and general attitude complete the illusion. Charlize looks so much like Aileen Wournos that when you put her picture next to the real killer's, the resemblance is so uncanny that it gives chills. She also looks a lot like James Hetfield of Metallica fame, but then, so did Aileen Wournos.Her performance is perfect, and Christina Ricci as her selfish, lesibian lover gives a performance that is also well worth watching. Ignorant of her lover's crimes, she pushes her to make more money for them, never realizing until much later that the money is coming from the dead men that are appearing all over Central Florida.Are we expected to feel sorry for Aileen Wournos now that we have the background on how and why she snapped and became this monster? Are we supposed to be sorry that we went to the electric chair? No. While this movie shows us that Aileen's first murder was in self defense, and the second murder was made easier by the post traumatic stress of her first experience, we also see that the other killings are completely calculated and her victims were generally innocent people. Briefly, we see her anguish at killing during an especially disturbing murder scene, but Wournos was not that sorry, so that scene doesn't inspire sympathy for her so much as it leaves a person feeling cold.I would have given this movie five stars except for one thing. The relationship she has with Shelby (Ricci) is too drawn out and slow in developing at first. Then, it seems to be more important than the murders, because we have more screen time with Theron and Ricci making out, arguing, or otherwise planning their next move than we do anything else, which seems to put the murders on the backburner.However, if you want disturbing non-fiction, this movie disturbs on two levels. The first is Charlize Theron herself. She is freakin' amazing. The second is the actual story. It is very hard to watch, but you will be glad you did.

This film is a perfect combination of ""Matrix"" and ""Inception"" and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level! ""Gravity"" is a life time experience that everyone must see! If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters, it just doesn't get better than that!Since this movie has so many genres, it's hard to tell its main one. This movie has adventure, comedy, sorrow, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense scary scenes and so much more! The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense. You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie. (Sandra Bullock)The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope. It seems like a casual spacewalk, but when she gets stranded away from her ship, ""Explorer,"" she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station. If you want to find out how and if she and her co-worker,  Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) make it back to Earth alive, you have to watch the film.The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics, it's hard not to like it! You feel like you are right there, experiencing whatever the main characters experience. The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it - what would you do, if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe, with nobody but yourself? What would your thoughts be? Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you? The camera work is the best I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece.My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel. She thinks she's stranded. Before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to Earth, she starts to see Matt. Matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back. As soon as his statement is over, he's gone. She hallucinated him but the plan worked!  It's a very interesting and important scene in the movie and that's why I like it.The movie is rated PG-13 and I honestly think it is appropriate for age 12 to 18.

"The Dark Knight is the sequel to director Christopher Nolan's outstanding and uplifting Batman Begins.  The depiction of the story in a gritty urban millieu gives it much greater gravitas than the standard superhero film. At times, it feels like one is watching a legal procedural drama like Law and Order. The Dark Knight acts chiefly as a showcase for the Joker character, played by the late Heath Ledger.  Ledger's performance is solid, but the other characters are ill-served by a script that places them firmly in supporting roles.  After awhile, the omnipotence (and omnipresence) of the Joker in this long film becomes truly annoying. He seems to be everywhere, planting hundreds of fifty-gallon drums of gasoline and fuses faster than Batman and the police can react.  The film also suffers the ""two-villain syndrome"" of most Batman features; attorney Harvey Dent is an integral part of the plot, but his Two-Face alter-ego is a late afterthought.  Two-Face's skeletal half-face is certain to traumatize impressionable children long afterwards. After the Joker has killed, corrupted, or defamed everyone in the film, one walks out of the theater numbly depressed; ""Why did I pay to go through this?""  Good question.

"del Toro's visual imagination is present in Pacific Rim, but his storytelling definitely is not.  At least the first half of the film is made up of voice over narratives, time jumps, and flashbacks.  It doesn't have a story so much as a vast sea of clumsy exposition, meant to establish extremely rote character arcs while instructing the audience on what everything is.  Charlie Hunnam's and Rinko Kinkuchi's characters both must overcome a lame contrived trauma beset on them by the Kaiju, giant CGI aliens/sea monsters.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is clunky when the characters talk to one another as well.  The actors must constantly fight del Toro's scifi mumbo jumbo to try to convey humanity.  Overall, Pacific Rim leaves the impression that its ideas were way to big for one movie, or simply not thought through.
