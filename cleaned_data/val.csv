"This movie is unbelievably tedious, mostly because there is nothing likable about either of the magicians (histrionically portrayed by Hugh Jackfman and Christian Bale), who compete to present the best magic trick at the turn of century. Most pleasing are Scarlett Johansson's thunderously big thighs wiggling as she prances around on stage--she epitomizes ""booty-licious.""

"FINALLY! I had to get that out after watching two pieces of crap that called themselves Batman. Joel Schumacher's reign of terror is over and Christopher Nole has taken the helm of the Dark Knight's latest project, Batman Begins. A tremendous improvement (how could it be worse than Jim Carry stealing the scenes or George in a nippled Batsuit?) over the last two and even grabs some ground from the gothic creations of Tim Burton, the original Batman and Batman Returns.This story, like everyone knows, tells how Bruce Wayne went from the orphened son of a multi-billionare to the Dark Knight, avenging his parent's deaths and fighting crime in Gotham City. It begins in the Far East where Bruce learns how to disappear into the night and fight his enemies. While CNN found this a stupid beginning and too ""Asian-martial artsy"", I thought there was no better place to begin. I mean, Batman's entire technique is the night, a concept used by those steathy assassin/spies called ninjas. Also, you can't expect Batman to take boxing lessons to beat people up; no, you've gotta go martial arts for that.Moving along, Bruce returns to Gotham, transformed from a Corescant-like wonder of dazzling heights and glimmer into a dark, Blade Runner-like LA, topped off with a island housing the poor, criminally insane, and modeled after a destroyed Hong Kong slum. In Gotham, we get the beginnings of Batman from Lucius Fox, a former board member of Wayne Enterprises played by Morgan Freeman, and the butler Alfred, played by the wonderfully English Michael Caine. However, Batman will find his troubles in the psychologically minipulative Dr. Crane, played by sinister Cillian Murphy, also known as The Scarecrow for the mask he wears. Crane uses a hallucinogen that induces horrifying day-mares which render the victim helpless in their own fear.Speaking of fear, this movie uses psychological fear to a greater extent than any superhero movie, actually more than most movies, I've ever seen. The Scarecrow isn't really scary (well, maybe the mask is a little odd, possibly frightening to younger audiences), but he doesn't need to be psychotic or powerful to induce fear, he uses your own. Bruce's own fears of the past (not to mention guilt over his parents' deaths) provide a much more humane look at a superhero, like that of Spiderman 2. You feel Bruce is human, rather than just a symbol, as he attempts to be as Batman.Overall, this film plays much better than the last two, possibly all, of the Batman's before. The cast is excellent (never seen one better for superhero films), the dialogue is witty (unlike the final Star Wars movie), and the plot is a great start to the Batman canon. The end leaves us with Batman, the new vigilante of Gotham, ready to take on the crime of the city, one villian at a time (and ready to find the REAL murderer of his parents, the Joker, who leaves his trademark card at the end).

"Let me go out on a limb here and just say 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is just as good as the 2009 reboot, and dare I say; a tad better! You need not be a lifelong fan to enjoy this spectacular roller coaster ride of a movie but if you are, you will enjoy it... O-SO-MUCH-BETTER! The inferences & nods to past TV episodes & the early movies of the 80's are in of themselves so richly rewarding. You will find yourself unable to control your smiling as you discover the creativeness of the writing, as the originality of the story keeps that 'alternate reality' concept going. This film is one of the most enjoyable films to come out in a long, long time. It is thoroughly entertaining. The audience I saw it with stood up and clapped. When was the last time you experienced that in a movie theater? As previously stated 'STID' propels you on a non stop roller coaster ride but also has a great deal of heart as well. The friendship dynamic between Spock & Kirk is further developed in a really great, dramatic way. Some reviewers poo-pooed the character traits of all the beloved crew as being tired & predictable. However, as a Star Trek fan, isn't that what we've come to expect? In fact a true fan would be truly disappointed if Scotty & McCoy did not behave accordingly. A major surprise awaits and is done in such a subtle unexpected manner that you never see it coming. That's all I'll say on that or I'll have to be indited for being a huge spoiler. There are a ton of special F/X but they are done well and are not over bearing, in fact they add & give the movie it's richness. I met Gene Roddenberry when I was in college and was in awe of the man. I know in my heart that he would be very proud of this handling of his brain-child. Kudos to J.J. Abrams, Kurtzman & Orci for the respect and dignity they continue to give this much loved story & the characters who inhabit the world of Star Trek. Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto shine. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly one of the best villains to come along in years. His malevolence & charm are a wonder to behold.  If you breathe, have a heart, enjoy fantastic movie making at it's best, this is the movie for you & the whole family. This definitely is a return visit movie & then maybe even another return after that. Can't wait for the DVD.

"Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace is how the Star Wars saga began. The way this movie connects to the others is amazing. We see the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn. We see the Sith, Darth Sidious and Darth Maul, who revelaed themselve to the Jedi for the first time in a millenia here. We see Palpatine living a double life as the good-hearted Senator from Naboo and as Darth Sidious. We see him manipulate the Senate in order to set his massive plan to take over the Republic into motion. We see the young Anakin Skywalker, who's fate is the evil Darth Vader, but who will eventually bring balance to the Force.Surely these things are enough to win over the Jar Jar haters. The good things in this movie greatly outweigh the bad. The lightsaber duel is suspensful, the space battle is exciting, the Gungan/Droid battle is amazing, the pod race is suspenseful, the special effects are dazzling, the music is moving and the story is intriguing.To know the true story of the Star Wars saga as a whole is to accept the Phantom Menace for what the great movie it is.

"Ok, not evil, but whatever.This lighthearted offering from Steven Spielberg is superior to `The Terminal' but not quite as infectious as his beauties like `E.T.'.  It is fun and exciting and engaging, but I find it also to be slightly forgettable.  It is one of those films that leaves no complaints while in the midst of enjoying it, but it isn't one that you're going to remember three days later.Make sense?The film tells the true story of con-man Frank Abagnale Jr., who by the time he was 21 had made a living at deceiving and `stealing' from the government.  He was a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, all the while never being any of those things.  He was, simply put, a genius.  Carl Hanratty was the FBI agent who was on his tail for years, never quite getting close enough to catch him (well, eventually), always one step behind.One thing to describe this film is `jovial'.  It is a happy fun film.  Within the restraints of the genre it works nicely.  It does lack the `human' element that could have really set this film apart (and made it more memorable).  While the film remains exciting and entertaining it lacks that gut punch that could have made this movie `mean something', and in the end it would have completed it.  That said, happy is what happy does, and happy does a lot for this film.  Not only is the plot rather boisterous, but the performances are all just so delightful.  Leonardo DiCaprio captures the suave and childlike adorableness of Frank Jr. rather remarkably.  A lot of my cinephile friends consider this one of his best performances.  I kind of agree, since it really capitalizes on everything that makes him such an endearing actor.  This is a far better performance than his confused turn in `Gangs of New York', which was released the same year.  Tom Hanks is perfectly matched here, for he really understands how to play up the genre here.  As many know, I am not a gigantic fan of Mr. Hanks, so for me to praise a performance takes a lot from me.  But, as anyone who knows me knows, I consider his lighthearted `non-baity' work to be his best (see `Big' and `That Thing You Do' for examples).  Christopher Walken may not be the most jovial character in the bunch (and he does insert the films only `human' element) but he nails his character.Also, look for Amy Adams in a scene stealing supporting role!All in all, `Catch Me If You Can' delivers a very strong and very likable experience.  It's a film that may not `stick with you', but it is a film you will have no quarrels with watching again and again.

"Now before my 1st 20 years ago review for the month of May X2 I thought I would review the 1st X Men movie as a kid you know I was a fan of the animated X Men show I had a lot of the toys & of course I was a fan of the animated show from the 90's & I always wanted a movie made about The X Men. So in the year 2000 X Men was released in theaters. Now I do enjoy all 3 movies cause I can get some entertainment out of The Last Stand but I have my problems with it & it's not as good as the 1st X Men movies. But getting to this review X Men was directed by Bryan Singer who directed the sequel to this movie as well as Apt Pupil The Usual Suspects & unfortantly Superman Returns. It stars Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, James Mardsen as Cyclops, Famke Janseen as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, Anna Paquin as Rouge, Rebecca Romjn as Mystique & Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The story is you start off in 1944 in Poland a boy named Eric Lehnsher who is seperated from his parents & they are being taken off to a gas chamber. This scene imo is better than X Men First Class where the guards are holding him back from getting to his parents & his mutant powers are triggered & he bends a metal gate the effects are so much better than those Secret World Of Alex Mack effects in First Class. So Eric goes on to become Magneto. Then you get to 50 years later you're introduced to this girl nmaed Marie who kiss her Boyfriend & she has mutant powers that that can take away peoples life force. It nearly kills her Boyfriend & he was put in a coma for 3 weeks Marie runs away from home & goes by the name of Rouge. She ends up in northern Alberta Cnaada she sees this cage fight going on where Wolverine is kicking a  s  s. Some guys start hounding Wolverine & pulls his claws out & The Bar Tender pulls a Shot Gun out on him Wolverine cuts it in 2. While he is leaving he discovers Rouge hiding in the back of his truck. He lets her go along. They are attacked by Sabertooth who works for Magneto but they are saved by Cycolps & Storm. Then you haved this Senator named Robert Kelly who wants to start up a Mutant Regerstration Program during the hearings he debates Jean Grey meanwhile you have Professor Xavier spot his old friend Eric & as you should know they have different view points Xavier wants peace with Mutants & Humans while Magneto wants a war. Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen had a good back & forth with each other in these movies. I have heard people say Professor X & Magneto in X Men First Class was better I'm sorry but James McAvoy is a bad actor & Michael Fassbender is an overrated actor & that movie is a crime compared to what was told in the animated series. Then you get to the mansion where Wolverine comes to & tries to escape he looks for Rouge but meets Professor Xavier he is told that this is a school for mutants & how he can help him figure out his past. Meanwhile Magneto hatches this plot to capture Senator Kelly & another of Magneto's hench men Toad is flying the helicopter & Mystique a shape shifter turns into 1 of Senator Kelly's aid's. Magneto infects him with Mutant powers. He escapes & tells The X Men what Magneto is up to. 1 night Rouge hears noises coming from Wolverine's room she goes to check on him he accidently sticks his claws in her & she starts to absorb his power. Mystique transforms into this student named Bobby who is a love interest of Rouge's & tells her that everyone is mad at her & she should leave. Mystique sets up Cerebro the supercomputer of Professor X uses to kill him. Rouge is tracked down to a train station. The Professor has Cyclops & Storm go to get her he has Wolverine stay he fells that Magneto is trying to but Wolverine takes Cyclops motorcycle & goes to get her anyway. While he talks to Rouge Magneto shows up takes Rouge the police try to stop Magneto but that doesn't work out for them. When Magneto turns the cops weapons on them Xavier uses his powers to save them. They figure out why Magneto took Rouge cause with her he can infect many people. Cause the machine he used on Senator Kelly nearly killed him. When The Professor used Cerbro it nearly kills him leaving him in a coma. You have the team suit up & go after Magneto. There is  this summit going on with all these World Leaders & Magneto wants to inffect them. The X Men fight off Mystique & Toad. Mystique transforms into Wolverine her & Wolverine have a pretty good fight. Meanwhile Storm,  Jean Grey & Cyclops have their troubles with Toad. Toad also spits some kind of slime into Jean Grey's face. Storm defeats & of course she has this stupid line. Then you have this scene where Mystique turns into Storm & she tells Wolverine they need to regroup but Wolverine knows it's not Storm by her scent & he stabs her in the stomach. Then you have scene that I felt this is what animated series Wolverine would say when Cyclops & Storm think Wolverine is Mystique & Cyclops wants him to prove it Wolverine says ""You're ad  i  c  k."" They get to the top of The Statue Of Liberty where Magneto traps them he also uses his powers to to move Wolverine's arms to his chest. Wolverine injures himself to break free has a good fight with Sabertooth he kills Sabertooth. Storm & Jean Grey compine their powers to get Wolverine to the top of the machine where he destroy's it & saves Rouge. Magneto is defeated you have Professor X tells Wolverine that there is this abandoned Military Base in Canada that might hold some secret of his past. The group find out Mystique is still alive & she is impersonating Senator Kelly. You have a great ending where you have Magneto tells Professor X that he will eventually escape & Xavier says he will be there to stop him. Now getting to the things I didn't care for they focused on Wolverine & not the entire X Men which they do a lot in all 3 movies  mainly in the 1st & 3rd. I didn't like what they did with Robert Kelly seeing as his character got important in the animated series. But the rest you had a cast that clikced well humor that worked good directing by Bryan Singer. Patrick Stewart was did a great job. Ian McKellen was great. Hugh Jackman pulled the role of Wolverine off so well. James Mardsen did a pretty good job. Famke Janseen was good. Halle Berry was decent. Anna Paquin was good. Rebecca Romjin was decent. Tyler Mane was ok. There isn't much more to say if you haven't seen X Men go see it along with the much better sequel X2. The next review will be 20 years ago X2 X Men United.

"The Premise:The Departed is a remake of the 2002 Chinese film 'Infernal Affairs.' Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) as a young boy gets sucked into working for Boston Irish Mafia boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). When he grows up, he ends up joining the State Police under Frank Costello's direction in order to be an inside man, or a rat, for the boss. Sullivan keeps Costello tipped off, and in-turn, Costello gives Sullivan information to help him solve cases. He promotes quickly and ends up working for the State Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) who's sole task is to bring down Frank Costello.Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is also a State Policeman, or ""Statey,"" who's troubled past brings him to the attention of Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) who heads up the undercover division of the Boston Police overseen by Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). Dignam and Queenan are convinced that Costigan's high intelligence combined with his dubious background make him unsuitable as a traditional cop, so they offer him a job as an off-the-books, deep cover agent meant to infiltrate Costello's gang.Things get hairy when Sullivan, now working for the SIU, learns with certainty that the police have an undercover cop infiltrated into Costello's gang. The police then begin to suspect Costello has a rat inside the force. Sullivan gets yet another promotion, but this time his job is to find the rat inside the force. The problem is he is the rat. Meanwhile, Costello has another job for Sullivan: find out who the undercover cop is! Dignam and Queenan know the only way they are going to find the rat is through Costigan who's life is becoming more dangerous by the second. Which of each other Sullivan or Costigan find out first is a deadman.Thoughts:The only two real flaws I found in Infernal Affairs were the scene direction and lack of character development. I knew these were two things that Martin Scorsese was a master of, so I was very eager to see his take on the story. Exactly as I predicted, The Departed is a much deeper version of the story. You get a much stronger feel for the characters. The story definately moves slower, but you never get bored during any scenes. As well, the dialogue benefits greatly from this, and it's simply great!It's a very rare thing for such a stellar cast as featured in this film to be used so well. Most of the time when a film touts such a list of screen icons, most of them have bit roles and barely make an impact on the film. Here everyone's presence is strongly felt, and it's a wonder to behold such a cast working on such a strong film under one of the greatest film directors in history. Jack Nicholson reminds us of why he's the legend he is. Leonardo DiCaprio slams the lid on naysayers, and even Mark Wahlberg's performance is so good he blends right in with the amazing talent around him. You may even find yourself talking about his character more than any other after the film.The film is not perfect however. It does tend to feel a bit too long once you reach the third act, but not so much as to sway your overall feelings of the film. I knew and expected the film to be different from it's Chinese counterpart if simply for the fact that these are different societies and cultures we are talking about, however I didn't expect (and didn't approve of) how much The Departed would walk the lines of every idea being so black and white. In The Departed, good cops are good, and the bad cops are bad. Scorsese even makes a strong point never to show Costigan performing any truly bad deeds. Meanwhile Infernal Affairs makes a strong point to show shades of grey where neither cop was truly good and neither was truly bad. Instead, it focused on how each lived in their own hell and how it motivated their actions. The ending to Infernal Affiars was deep and thoughtful, while by comparison, The Departed feels almost cliche and very much like a ""Hollywood Ending.""The Verdict:The Departed is easily the best crime drama since Heat. It's everything Miami Vice should have been. Martin Scorsese was born to make films like this, and this film is easily his best film since Goodfellas which coincidentally or not so coincidentally share common themes. In this film he masterfully weaves a complicated web of intrigue and deception. It may not be perfect, but damn is this one hell of a good film!

"This version of Jane Austen's fine novel, Pride and Prejudice, is really quite spectacular.  The casting is splendid.  The actress who plays Elizabeth Bennett's mother is absoultely hilarious.

"Going into HtTYD, I was quite skeptical about the whole affair.  Being more of a Horror-Movie buff than anything else, I don't really expect much out of other genres - although, to be fair, I don't expect much out of Horror either.  Few movies have the kind of insight; synthesis of talent; and stellar presentation to win me over; and if you compound this general statement of artistic scarcity with a marked lack of even the most petty of scares, I'm usually ready to not watch and say that I did.  Well, this happens to be one of the occasions where I'm glad I was talked into watching.  Despite a silly, somewhat childish approach to the topic (although this was almost necessary, and actually lent the movie its charm), HtTYD does what few movies manage to do: it engaged me on an emotional level.  Indeed, even having watched this movie once before, I still found myself reacting as if I'd never seen it before - an unusual event for any artistic endeavor.Story-wise, from the standpoint of the generally accepted &#34;NO SPOILERS&#34; rule, there's not much to tell: Vikings kill dragons (like they do); boy meets dragon; boy saves everyone because of dragon.  But this simplicity does nothing to detract from the experience, as it's character interaction and dedication to the roles that wins the day on this venture.  Despite humor that ranges from goofy to pre-adolescent, never once did I feel myself becoming disengaged from the spectacle.  No one character is overbearing or underwhelming; and all of the actors manage to pull their roles together in a way that does nothing but show this gem for what it really is.  In short, and without being too mushy (which I doubt I could stand for more than a picosecond), the film does so much right as to make me promote it as a family classic.For those of you with a serous case of TLDR: good presentation and good acting turn a silly movie into a charming one that managed to make my day without even one drop of blood spilled - impressive for a bunch of Vikings.  I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone, particularly if you have young children.

"They really should have halves.The Blair Witch Project is an okay, ridiculously over-hyped movie. However, truth be told, there are a lot scarier and a lot better made movies out there that you could be seeing.  Yes, this is an okay movie. It got a lot of hype because of it's  &quot;inventive&quot; documentary style (this has been used before, see  some cult horror movies). It got too much hype, so much that the final  product couldn't live up to it, especially if you're seeing it now.While  Blair Witch does have some genuinely scary moments, they are precious few.  I kept getting the feeling that the film's style was just a gimmick rather  than an actual attempt at making it look like a documentary.

"I went into this movie expecting to be entertained, and I was - very much so. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" works very well because of the amazing chemistry between the two leads, the ridiculously good-looking Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The film opens with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith in marriage counseling, and apparently, the magic has gone out of their marriage, probably because they can't speak truthfully about their jobs. They don't know that they are both skilled assassins, but when they are hired to do a hit on each other, the truth unravels. The plot is rather brainless, but I realized about ten minutes into the movie that I really didn't care.The first part of the film is more enjoyable and successful than the second part, mainly because it's fun to watch the Smiths not realize the truth about each other and then dance on eggshells around each other when they think they know the truth. The dialogue is witty, and filled with great one-liners and double entendres. Take, for example, when John and Jane return home for dinner after trying to kill each other, and John says, in response to Jane's question of why he has returned early from his so-called business trip, ""I missed you."" She replies, matter-of-factly, ""I missed you, too."" The movie is often very funny, although most laughs come from when they're doing generic couple stuff (like seeing a counselor, eating dinner at home, brushing their teeth, etc.).""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" relies mostly on the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and they have that in spades. The sex appeal literally explodes off the screen, and I wish the film spent more time laboring over the couple-stuff they do and not so much the explosions and action. Jolie has never looked better or more hypnotically beautiful than in this movie, and it's pretty obvious why Pitt's character falls for her almost instantly. I also thought that Jolie was great at making her Jane Smith character a real person; she brings a quiet poignancy to the role. As John Smith, Pitt is wickedly funny and excellent. He gets all the best lines. In the hands of a lesser actor, his lines would sometimes seem corny, but Pitt makes his character believable and extremely likable. The supporting characters (played by Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, and Vince Vaughn) seem a bit wasted, but this is, after all, the Brad and Angelina show.My main problem with the film is the excessive (and often plodding) action scenes. While it is fun to watch Pitt and Jolie look sexy while doing cool stunts, it gets tiring pretty quickly. This is the primary reason that the last thirty minutes or so of the film aren't as witty or entertaining as the earlier moments in the film. I think the movie could have been improved if there were less physical explosions and mindless action and more of the explosive chemistry in the quieter scenes between Pitt and Jolie.Despite its flaws, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a wonderful way to spend two hours at the theatre. Not a movie for anyone demanding a real plot or serious depth, but worth a rental, at least. 4/5.

"It's hard to believe that the company that made this incredible film; Constantin Film; also made the excellent Resident Evil films and the not-so-great Fantastic Four movies (bleh). This war movie is absolutely fantastic and well-deserving of the many awards and critical acclaim it received.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The year is 1945, and the Russians are closing in on Germany and the Third Reich. So the main leaders of the Third Reich; Adolph Hitler, Eva Braun, Joseph Goebbel along with his wife and children, and various employees and military leaders hide in a bunker to avoid capture from the Russians. The story is basically told from the point of view from Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, who was in the bunker during the last days of the war and a witness to the downfall of the Third Reich and escaping from the Russians.MUSIC: There's not much unfortunately, that's what makes this movie flawed.STORYLINE: This story is well told about these historical events and is beautifully and masterfully carried out.ENTERTAINMENT: This film is brilliant, and near-perfection. This is one of those movies you have to have real taste for, otherwise you might get bored. It definitely isn't for kids. What makes this film all the more authentic is that the film is in German giving the already amazing feel another injection of compelling drama. This is one of the best war dramas (and dramas in general) ever made, it's compelling, the acting is great, it feels very real, and it is a masterpiece.OVERALL: You're not going to find a whole lot of foreign films this great, or for that matter, great films in particular (Hollywood really sucks these days; there is virtually nothing good to speak of). Watch this movie, you owe it to your movie-loving self to watch one of the best dramas, best war movies, best foreign movies, and one of the best movies to come out in years. This is not my favorite movie, but this is one of the more better quality films I've watched in a while amid the many stinkers I've watched.THE GOOD: Great story, great actors, feels authentic, it's brilliant, and it's just a flatout masterpiece.THE BAD: Very little music.

"""The Passion Of The Christ"" is brilliant and one of the best pictures of the year, so far! The movie focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus' (Jim Caviezel) life leading up to his death and resurrection. This movie has some very graphic scenes, but don't let the violence concern you. It is a powerful depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, thanks in part to its director, the brilliant Mel Gibson, who directed and starred as Justin Mcleod in ""The Man Without A Face"" and William Wallace in ""Braveheart"", the latter, which won him the Best Director Oscar.

His directing in this movie is brilliant without compromise. Everything he did to make this movie has paid off brilliantly. The cast including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother, are brilliant as well. Caviezel's performance as Jesus, is emotionally powerful and brilliant and as the co-anchor of the movie, besides, Gibson, does a brilliant job as much as Gibson did. Gibson's production company, Icon Productions, has produced movies of his such as, ""The Singing Detective"" (2003), ""Payback"" (1999), ""What Women Want"" (2000), ""Braveheart"" (1995), ""We Were Soldiers"" (2002), ""Fairy Tale: A True Story"" (1997), ""Forever Young"" (1992), ""Hamlet"" (1990), ""The Man Without A Face"" (1993), and ""Maverick"" (1994).

"Going into The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I knew that it was a tale originally written for children, but the Lord of The Rings trilogy was so well done, that I fully expected the first Hobbit movie to be just as masterful. It was a pretty good film, however it didn't have the luster that Lord of The Rings had. The trilogy was magical, it's the reason people go to the movies, but the Hobbit, seemed to be playing off the fame of the Lord of The Rings and at times was directionless. For those who don't know the story, it starts to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his original journey with Gandalf. In the Lord of The Rings, they go on this impossible journey in order to save Middle Earth, but here, the journey is about saving the dwarfs gold from a dragon. It really doesn't have the intensity or the urgency require to make a film like this work. Nothing had changed for over two hundred years, but all of a sudden, now is the time to stop the dragon, why? The film was not bad, but it doesn't come off as this great adventure and that could have something to do with the childish elements. This is a PG-13 film with fighting and beheadings, yet it's also a film with singing dwarfs, drunk gnomes, and a wizard with Alzheimer who is covered in bird s***. I feel these things really hurt the film. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and finally seemed to be showing his age. McKellen is tired and slow in this film, Gandalf is not the same great warrior. Finally, this film is different because we know it's a prequel. Even if you didn't read the book, you know who lives and who dies, taking a major play away from the screenwriters. Overall the Hobbit is somewhat entertaining, but it's not The Lord of The Rings. It's directionless at times, lacks the urgency needed for an epic, and has a cast that really doesn't excite. I was hoping for a lot, but all I got was a little. The only thing I can do now is try and forget about it as I wait for the next film with anticipation.

"""Ray,"" Taylor Hackford's new movie based on the life of the great Ray Charles, is a strange blend.  I liked some aspects of this film very much.  Other parts gave me a bad case of the biopic blues.The flashbacks that depict Ray's childhood as a poor, fatherless boy living in Florida with his mother and his brother are wrenching and heartbreaking.  Sharon Warren, as Ray's mother Aretha, is a standout.  She is a formidable individual who rejects self-pity and never allows Ray to feel sorry for himself, even after he loses his sight.  CJ Sanders, as young Ray, has an incredibly expressive face that speaks volumes.  I also admired the beautiful Kerry Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife, Della Bea, a woman who stands by her man, although he betrays her time and time again.By now, most people know that Jamie Foxx will probably be Oscar nominated for his uncanny, dead-on performance as Ray Charles.  Foxx exhibits all of Charles's physical quirks and captures the nuances of his personality, including his unique musical genius, tremendous ambition, manipulative and predatory behavior towards the women in his life, and his self-destructive drug habit.  For every moment of this film, Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  Period.  The glorious music of Ray Charles permeates the film and I still can't get ""Hit the Road Jack"" out of my head.There were other portions of this film that irritated me.  Taylor Hackford bears much of the blame for some of the clunky and heavy-handed lines, and the absurd, over-the-top sequences that seem to spring straight out of a forties movie.  The worst of these are the ""Aha!"" moments when Charles suddenly gets an inspiration out of nowhere, and his producers all sit around grinning from ear to ear, agreeing that this is the sound that will make them all rich.  There is too much foreshadowing and melodrama, and the direction and cinematography sometimes lack the subtlety that would have made ""Ray"" a truly great movie.Still, you should see ""Ray"" for the three or four very fine performances and for the superb music.  These alone are worth the price of admission. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Do you like the film?,887,"{'text': ['liked some aspects of this film very much'], 'answer_start': [102]}"
"One of the MOST anticipated Blu Ray release of all time is finally here.  We've all seen it numerous times and every media outlet imaginable has either quoted it or used it as a hook for our attention.  Why does it get our attention?  Because it is one of those films that has an in depth fantastic world with clear defined lines of good and evil, backed with a powerful plot filled with likable and detestable characters.  Most of all it's so much fun to watch, because no matter what age you are it brings the kid inside of you alive.Alive is what you will feel when viewing these Blu Rays.  These Blu Rays are by far the most impressive I have ever seen of an older movie restored, many times unbelievable was the word that came to mind.  Picture quality on all three films is crisp and clear, the best they have ever looked and then some.  The light sabres glow with intensity, Darth Vaders helmet shines with mirror like blackness and certain scene details come to life for the first time.  Several times I found myself looking at the characters detailed surroundings instead of the character themselves.  The picture quality on all three films has been so thoroughly examined there are not any moments where you wish they could have done more in any particular scene.  The picture quality is simply amazing and your eyes will be glued to the screen with the dynamic DTS HD Master Audio mix that draws you in with its dynamic use of the sound field.The picture quality is amazing, but the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is in one word AWESOME. If ever you wanted to be immersed into the Star Wars universe this soundtrack will leave you awestruck. Star Destroyers rumble the scene as they pass over, Tie fighters scream from the rears to the fronts as they fly over and fight scenes come alive like an actual war is taking place in your media room.  AT-ATs, Speeder Bikes, Darth Vader's voice...I could go on and on about this unbelievable soundtrack.  Sound is so important to bring a movie to life and Lucas spared nothing on this soundtrack to give these classics a new dynamic feel.Overall, a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan.  These films have never looked or sounded better then they do in this aweinspiring release.  I am going to go out on a limb and say this is by far the best Blu Ray release of the year.  Do not fall into what so many have already done and not buy because of additions to the ""original"" theatrical version.  These additions are minor and do nothing to the overall enjoyment you will feel when watching these films in HD.  I encourage everyone to do what I did and buy these films and watch them for the first time, you will be amazed at all that HD has done for these films.

"This movie wouldn't have been bad if it were an hour and a half long. Almost 3 hours is ridiculous and pretentious. This isn't an assignment, there was no need or requirement to make this 3 hours long, especially when there was no point to doing so. I think it was much better than the past Lord of the Ring movies, but at a certain point, you could tell that all the actors were exhausted and the movie began to lose focus. If I had one wish, it would be for the next movies to come in under 2 hours long. Almost 3 hours without a point is just pushing it. The LOTR movies suffer from the same problem as the Harry Potter films. There is absolutely no point to making them ridiculously long. The audience doesn't benefit, it is more work for the film makers, and theaters can't turn over showings as often. Furthermore, casual fans will simply not bother. A great movie with a great plot can be 3 hours long. This shouldn't be. It has no business being so. In the editing process, a director should see that a film is dragging and start cutting scenes. Peter Jackson is NOT a bad film maker. I've seen his other films, which were fantastic. I have no idea why with LOTR, he is fixated with lengthening the time out?Hopefully, this will change after the somewhat lackluster reviews of the last film, but it's doubtful.

"I can't figure out who this is marketed to.  It seems like New Line is trying to come up with every combination of Lord of the Rings footage they can get onto different DVD editions.  Let me explain exactly what you get here:2 discs for each of the 3 movies, 6 discs total. 1 disc contains the theatrical edition of the film on one side and the extended edition on the other.  The second disc contains a brand new two-hour featurette by filmmaker Costa Botes.  The featurettes are basically a guy walking around with a camera while people get ready on the set and filming people.  They are not comprised of 30 minute ""making of Helms Deep set"" specials or anything like that.Apparently, New Line has to release the films with the documentaries due to contractual obligations, however, I still can't see anyone but the most hard core of fans buying these.  The documentaries are actually quite good, and it's too bad they weren't on one of the other versions that has been released.  But unless you are solely buying these discs for the documentaries (and even then, they're not so good as to charge this much), you don't not want this set.  The discs do not contain Dolby DTS surround sound, and they contain literally NOTHING aside from the films.  No commentaries or anything.As I said, the documentaries are pretty interesting if you're a huge fan and can afford that much money to watch Sean Astin make jokes about his makeup or scenes of bloopers and stuntmen falling off their horses, but if you are looking at purchasing this for any other reason or to own a copy of the movies, I strongly suggest you get one of the other trilogy sets instead.

"Having a young child, we were waiting for this movie to come out on cable or dvd -- no chance of going to a theater yet!  So we were delighted to receive an advance copy from an online store and Disney/PIXAR.  We've watched the film at least six times in the past four days.The movie is terrific -- one of those films that children of different ages can enjoy AND adults can watch multiple times without going insane.  This is the story of Monsters Incorporated, an energy supply company based in Monstropolis.  In this reality, energy comes in the form of children's screams, and to that end Monsters, Inc. employees emerge from closets all over the world in order to collect a few GigaHowls and keep everyone's lamps and toasters running.  The best scare team at Monsters, Inc.  is John ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his assistant Mike (Billy Crystal).  One evening after hours, a child gets through a closet door and enters Monstropolis.  Not good, considering monsters are scared of kids and believe their touch is toxic.  Over the course of the movie Sulley and even Mike become attached to ""Boo"", risking health and careers to get her back to her home.  In the meantime, incorrigible adorable Boo is having a great time scaring all the big monsters.The film is incredibly well done, as technically flawless as earlier PIXAR productions, the Toy Story series and A Bug's Life, but even funnier.  John Goodman perfectly voices gentle, affable Sulley, and Billy Crystal creates Mike, a frantic egotist who is also optimistic and loyal.  In other words, with more depth than half the human characters being written today.  The animation is stunning, and the story is lots of fun.  Nothing here to disturb little kids, and a lot to entertain them.  The only part I didn't like much was the opening credit sequence, which was reminiscent of 60s bedroom farces, but that's what the Select Scene feature is for.There are two discs here.  On Disc One you can view the film in fullscreen or widescreen format.  Audio commentary by the director and staff is available with the latter.  English captions, audio and video optimizers, and sneak peeks at PIXAR's upcoming ""Finding Nemo"" and Disney's ""Lilo & Stitch"" are also here.  Disc Two contains almost three-and-a-half hours of amazing dvd extras. There's an interesting 20-minute tour of PIXAR; a very funny bloopers reel (that also plays during the credits of the fullscreen version); storyboards; deleted scenes; recording studio footage; character design; trailers and tv spots; footage of the Hollywood premiere; discussion of tie-in toys; a poster gallery; two Monsters Inc.-related segments from Ponkickies, a goofy Japanese animated show; Peek-a-Boo, a game; a history of Monster World; a Monsters Inc. employee handbook; and an introduction to Monsters Inc.'s version of baseball cards called Scarer Cards.  The 13-minute original treatment and several scenes from an alternative story are presented that are as funny as the one that made it to the screen.Our favorite extras were the outtakes; a new animated short, ""Mike's Car""; the Oscar winning PIXAR short, ""For the Birds""; fly-arounds of several movie locations; the guide to ""in"" jokes (eg, the appearance of Toy Story 2's Jessie when Boo is showing her favorite toys to Sulley); a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the technical wizardry required to produce complex backgrounds, Sulley's fur, Boo's shirt and the city of Monstropolis; being able to watch a scene as it was done in storyboard, layout, animation or finished presentation; and a fun 4-minute clip with a few seconds of dialogue in each of the 30+ languages into which the film was translated.  There's even a brief appearance by PIXAR CEO Steve Jobs.Packaging and foldout are nice, and include a contest entry form (to win Disney dvds), a free tie-in storybook offer, and a coupon book (for popcorn; Monsters Inc. tie-ins; Disney storybooks, videos and dvds; and Disney on Ice).  With one exception we ran everything on our dvd player without a glitch, and could not be more pleased with this very funny family film and the many many extra features.Highest recommendation.

"I recently received my copy of the Phantom Menace DVD and am quite pleased with it.  I must say that the sound quality of the DVD is really quite amazing.  The sound and picture quality and special effects alone are worth the price of the DVD.Despite the strengths of the special effects, I must say that the script and the acting are extremely weak at times during the movie.  For example, little 5-year-old Anakin Skywalker hits on the Princess at many times during the movie.  Those scenes are extremely unrealistic.  I just find it really hard to believe that little brat would flirt that much with the adult princess.Also, Anakin Skywalker simply cannot act.  That boy basically reads his lines without much emotion.  I think that the little kid from the 6th Sense would have played a much better Anakin Skywalker.What genius decided that it would be a good idea to have JarJar Binks in almost every scene?  I do understand that JarJar is supposed to provide comic relief.  However, JarJar is not funny at all - he's just really annoying.And what's the deal with the Jedi blood test?  Why could they do this at the time of the first episode, but not at any time during episodes 4-6?  Was the technology simply lost?

"Acclaimed filmmaker James Cameron once again made cinematic history with the breathtaking science fiction blockbuster Avatar. In the distant future, a handicapped ex-Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) accepts a job to aid a human colony in their mining venture in the jungle planet of Pandora where its inhabitants known as the Na'vi are strongly against the destruction to their home. Using an alien hybrid called an avatar, he makes contact with the Na'vi and becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is an extraordinary and visually groundbreaking film spectacle that ranks as one of the most imaginative Sci-Fi movies in cinema history. Thought the story may be a somewhat clich&eacute;d with obvious stereotypes, the film is nevertheless entertaining and embracing. Cameron and his technical crew have spent many years developing the technology to create this Sci-Fi world and its inhabitants. Avatar represents an impressive leap in special effects and 3D technology.

I'm sure a fight could be a liberating experience because most of  us go through life trying to avoid confrontation for whatever reason.

"This movie has a lot going for it, Superb animation, memorable songs, the characters on the whole are very likable, though a couple of improvements could have been made. Starting with Anastasia herself. Who seemed a bit too  self centered for my tastes. Which is pretty common with female characters  in most animated films, but she in particular seems to be driven ONLY by  her own needs. Wanting to know about her past and finding her family is  fine, but it would have been nice if she had be shown to express concern  for, or helping out someone else during the course of the movie.  To this  day I still think the most enduring female character in an animated movie  has to be Mrs. Frisby from The Secret of Nimh. A character motivated not by  finding Prince Charming, but who's strife and hidden courage comes from  trying to save the life of her child. A character you truly feel for. I  really wish more characters could be written like that.It would have  also been better to see more of why Rasputin hated the Romanovs so much,  which BTW makes you wonder, if he was out to obliterate the Romanovs  completely why didn't he go after the Grandmother, wasn't she one too?I  do believe Anastasia is a really good film, if not perfect, and I recommend  seeing it.

"I really did enjoy the theatrical release of 'Fellowship' and thought that, along with many others, that New Line was doing 2 different DVD releases of the film to 'cash in' on the fans.I still decided to pick up the extended version, and I feel like it was a good use of my hard-earned money.First of all, the 30 extra minutes are well used, really expanding on the characters and the world of Middle Earth.  I don't really mind the fact that it's on two discs.  It's like the intermission that the epic films like 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Cleopatra' had.  It's a chance to stretch one's legs a bit.  It probably would have been impossible to fit the 4 commentaries, the Dolby 5.1 audio track, and a DTS audio track, along with the 3 1/2 hour film without the quality suffering. The picture and audio quality are great because the film is spread out a bit.The actors that were cast in this film are fantastic.  Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, and Viggo Mortensen are particularly convincing in their roles.The commentaries are a treasure for the film buff or aspiring film maker.  It is facinating to hear 4 different angles on the film.The two discs of documentaries are superb.  I can't recall any DVD release covering the film making process in such detail.  Watching the documentaries makes me admire Peter Jackson even more than before.  He is a man who genuinely admires Tolkien's work.  He is not doing this to 'cash in'.  If he truly wanted to cash in, he could have just gone to Australia or England, found a sound stage and done the entire trilogy using sound stages and CGI. He didn't though.  He filmed the majority of the films on locations in his homeland, New Zealand, and many crews took many months recreating Middle Earth.  Peter Jackson has devoted several years to these films now and deserves the financial rewards that are coming to him.A truly enjoyable adventure and one that I look forward to reliving many times.

"Ok, ok...so I saw this in the theater 2 years ago when it was released.  I had a good feeling about it upon entering the theater; however, I left the theater feeling like someone had jumped me in the parking lot and stolen my wallet AND gas money.  (flash foward 2 years to this week) I saw this DVD on sale at a local discount store for $5.  I like horror movies, I hadn't seen it in a while, and it was only $5...So,  I thought ""what the hell?"" I'll buy it and add it to my collection.  I should have spent the $5 on the gumball machines in the lobby of the discount store instead, honestly.  I am typically NOT one to knock horror since it's my favorite genre and I especially love the cheesy ones, but this movie has a serious identity problem. It tries to be horror/funny much like EVIL DEAD 2 and it fails, no make that TERRIBLY fails at doing that. It starts out promising enough, kinda a mix between Wrong Turn and Friday the 13th.  YES, the script is terrible (unless you think uttering the F word in place of anything else is creative).  The characters are all hollow, stupid and unsympathetic, even for a cheesy horror film (except for the blonde girl).  Rider Strong was probably the best part about this movie, and that ain't sayin much considering his claim to fame was that TGIF show ""Boys Meets World"".  You should know the plot by now from reading the actual summary listed on this website, so I won't go into the whole ""flesh eating virus"" bit.  Basically, it's nasty.  Gross.  Unnecessarily BAD.  Why does the girl insist on shaving her legs when she knowingly has something that looks like Herpes of the leg?  It tries to be overly gross just to see how far it can go.

There is probably a small audience that loves this movie, I can probably see why, but I don't connect with that reasoning.

"""Avatar"", the largest-grossing movie of all time and has cemented James Cameron's status as a writer and director who has been able to surpass his original box office record with his 1997 film ""Titanic"".Created with an outstanding budget of $237 million, needless to say that James Cameron has laid it all on the line with this film.  It would become a financial disaster or a goldmine.  And sure enough, ""Avatar"" has become the latter.  The film has grossed over $2.7 billion and with this Blu-ray and DVD release, during the first two days of its sale, it has sold over $5 million copies.Needless to say, this is the easily James Cameron's masterpiece.  Avoiding anything that resembles sci-fi kitsch with the use of its CG and becoming just eye candy, ""Avatar"" is a fantastic film that deserves to be seen and this is coming from a reviewer who was more than caustic towards this film before reviewing this Blu-ray release.VIDEO:""Avatar"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1) and is the true definition of reference quality video.  Detail and colors are just amazing.  The close up of the CG work looks so realistic and are so remarkably detailed that it looks as if Cameron and crew have achieved CG perfection.  You see skin pores, the application of the pain on the skin, the sweat glistening on the characters.  How do they do that?  There is amazing detail in land of Pandora as each step and each touch produces this light around a plant or surrounding and the colors just glow and look fantastic in HD.And it just doesn't stop there.  There is detail everywhere.  From the mecha vehicles that Spec-Ops command, the large vehicle units, the creatures on Pandora are shown with a large assortment of colors.This is the best looking film on Blu-ray that has come since the first release of Blu-ray discs.  I know this is a statement that is hard to believe especially with so many fantastic reference quality releases on BD but ""Avatar"" has set the bar up high of how gorgeous a film can look on Blu-ray.  Incredible!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Avatar"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English Dolby Surround, English Decruption Audio, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And you think that ""Avatar"" has raised the bar for picture quality, the audio for ""Avatar"" is equally fantastic!Immersive.  This is the word I describe this film as the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless audio track takes control of your soundscape and sound is coming from the front and center channels, surround channels are active throughout the film. May it be the forest ambiance, creatures rustling in the leaves, large animals heard flying above and of course, the pulse-pound action as the LFE is fully engaged.  Expect your subwoofer (and literally all channels) to go on over-drive as the film, especially during the second half of ""Avatar"" makes those scenes come alive.  The vehicles flying and the rotors blowing the trees, missiles firing and causing destruction and trees falling everywhere and the scream of the Omaticaya's as they are losing their home.Again... Incredible!As for subtitles, ""Avatar"" is presented in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Avatar"" does not come with any special features but more than likely we will see a ultimate edition coming out later this year.EXTRAS:""Avatar"" comes with a slipcase and a DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1, English, Spanish and French Dolby Surround.JUDGMENT CALL:When ""Avatar"" was released in theaters, I admit that I took a caustic approach to the film.It's not that dislike James Cameron films because I have enjoyed many of his films but it deals with my feelings of technology and films infused by CG that the more I see a sci-fi film utilizing it to the nth degree, I look at these films as becoming kitsch.  Granted, I'm not expecting the return of thousands of talents and epic filmmaking along the reigns of D.W. Griffith's ""Intolerance"" but when I saw the trailer for ""Avatar"", I was sensing CG eye candy ala ""Transformers II: Revenge of the Fallen"".With so many films being released on 3-D (which I have been told that ""Avatar"" must be seen in 3-D), in some ways, I just want to watch my movies straight.  It's not the 3-D that makes me excited, it's the good ol' fashioned form of cinema.  But with today's technology, for a sci-fi film, I'm expecting a beautiful scenery in this new world, unique characters, good acting, well-paced and a well-written storyline and most of all, because it's James Cameron who has raised the bar with ""Titanic"", I expect the best and not sci-fi kitsch.Of course, ""Avatar"" has gone on to breaking records and fan anticipation of the Blu-ray and DVD release are high (despite the first release being barebones) and upon receiving my review copy, I admit that I was curious about the film.  What will James Cameron bring to the big screen in terms of character development, storyline and what message does he have for the viewer.  Without it becoming an all eye candy film.Well, let's just say that after I watched ""Avatar"", I was blown away.  Yes, ""Avatar"" is eye candy but it's pleasing eye candy that has a strong storyline behind it.  Films such as the ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" films have been able to take the viewer and let them believe they are away from reality and you know these worlds.  That is why so many decades later, people still know the settings, the surroundings of these films and the same can be said about ""Avatar"".Like those films that will forever be etched in the minds of movie fans, ""Avatar"" will do the same as people will remember the lush world of Pandora, it's creatures but most of all the Na'vi.  Technology is to the point where creatures or other life forms do not need to don a rubber suit or wear excessive make-up to make one think that being is from another planet.  Somehow the wizards were able to take the likeness if Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana and make the characters of Jake Sully and his avatar, Neytiri and Dr. Grace Augustine come alive.The detail of this film is amazing.  On Blu-ray, it's fantastic!  The detail and vibrant colors come alive in full effect.  The characters on both the human and Na'vi side are believable and the acting is not forced.  I admit that very early on the film, I thought about the character of Jake Sully (and no offense to Sam Worthington) but we were going to get something similar to Channing Tatum's Duke (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"") and deal with a character that was concerned about his own virility and place as a soldier on Pandora but that is not the case.  Worthington's Sully is a man is a disabled man who has found new life using his Avatar, the ability to take part in lifestyle of the Omaticaya, embrace it and find love with Neytiri, the planet and its inhabitants.The chemistry between the characters of Jake Sully and Neytiri is natural but works extremely well.  And for fans of James Cameron films, to see Sigourney Weaver in ""Avatar"" is a nostalgic blessing.  She may not be as forceful as her character of Ripley in the ""Alien"" films but her role as Dr. Grace Augustine was well-done.In fact, I felt the movie and it's pacing for a longer film was well-done, the viewer is immersed in the world but also gets to see political corruption and greed come to play and how Cameron is able to work this film and make it exciting and believable underneath all the CG is quite amazing.  What the ""Star Wars"" films were to me back in the late '70s and early '80s, ""Avatar"" was a film that captivated my attention throughout its 162 minutes and made me appreciate what sci-fi films today can accomplish (granted, not many films will ever get the budget that Cameron was able to achieve with this film).But as this film has received mostly positive reviews, I was surprised to read ""Salon"" critic Stephanie Zacharek's opening paragraph of her review.  Zacherek writes, ""The problem with taking 15 years to bring audiences the future of filmmaking is that someone else is bound to get to the future before you do. And while there are certain technical effects in James Cameron's ""Avatar"" that aren't quite like anything we've ever seen before, the movie is hardly a historical event, or even a grand achievement. It is  a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of `Attack of the Clones'.""I disagree with Zacharek's comment of the movie is a grand achievement.  The film has broken box office records worldwide and now has its place in the record books as the #1 earning film in the world.  Granted, for critics...many probably didn't think early on that James Cameron could repeat his box office success that he did with ""Titanic"", let alone beat that record with a sci-fi film.  But he did and if that is not an grand achievement, I don't know what Zacharek was expecting. Even if you remove yourself from the earnings, the CG work is amazing.  The cinematography is amazing and just the amount of detail on the characters at this time is phenomenal.  And when you think about its competition during the Oscar year, ""Avatar"" was deserving in winning ""Best Achievement in Art Direction"", ""Best Achievement in Cinematography"" and ""Best Achievement in Visual Effects"".She goes on to say that the film was under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and like many sci-fi films, there must be action.  You know early on that there is a war coming between the humans and the Na'vi.  It's expected, it's going to happen and yes, you are going to lose some of that emotional connect through those sequences.  And the ""godawful dialogue"", I did mention this earlier on in my review that I felt that the character of Jake Skully was getting near Channing Tatum's Duke but for ""Avatar"", it works. Skully is introduced in the beginning as someone completely opposite of his intellectual brother and it shows.But similar to Zacharek, I was surprised that ""Village Voice"" critic J. Hoberman would feel the same about the second half as well.  Hoberman writes, ""For the first 45 minutes, I'm thinking: Metropolis!--and wondering how to amend ballots already cast in polls of the year's best movies. Then the 3-D wears off, and the long second act kicks in.""I found the comment to be quite interesting and for the most part, I can see where Hoberman is coming from in comparisons of both films.  Where the Fritz Lang epic featured a man from the upper-level associating with and underground woman in which the underground has been subjective to corporate corruption to its highest level, I see the connection but at the same time, comparing ""Metropolis"" and ""Avatar"" is comparing apples to oranges.  Where both films feature a revolt, ""Metropolis"" denizens have lived their monotonous life the same every day and are not warriors.  In ""Avatar"", the Na'vi are losing their homeland, their planet is being destroyed and they have either the choice to give up and move to another area or fight.  And what kind of film would ""Avatar"" be if we watched these warriors being displaced?The second half needed that battle and like ""Metropolis"", where Freder joins Maria in the grand fight, Sully joining the Na'vi was just right!  That battle needed to be epic and for an audience who have sat that long at the theater for something grand to happen, this was their pay off. Yes, the film is pragmatic but for a sci-fi film, it works and definitely not kitsch.So, I came away enjoying ""Avatar"" much more than I expected.  The Blu-ray delivered in picture and audio quality.  Special features are none but similar to ""Sin City"" which came out with a near barebones DVD release was then given a magnificent Blu-ray release much later and it's expected the same will happen to ""Avatar"".  I am sure like the video releases of ""Titanic"" and ""Terminator 2', Cameron has a lot of planned for the upcoming ultimate or special edition of ""Avatar"".  This release was just to satisfy the masses who have enjoyed the film and definitely looks and sounds incredible in HD.I know many people may hold off until the better version of ""Avatar"" is released on Blu-ray but for now, if you want to enjoy ""Avatar"" now, you can.  James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is the best looking film on Blu-ray since the release films on Blu-ray disc.  Although, this is not the ultimate release of ""Avatar"" and does not include any special features, in terms of picture and audio quality alone, ""Avatar"" has not only broken box office records, it has raised the bar on what perfection looks and sounds like on Blu-ray.Highly recommended!

"It's been four years since Slumdog Millionaire took home eight Oscars. I found myself thinking of that movie because Life of Pi opens in India and the cast is predominantly comprised of Indian actors. Like Slumdog Millionaire, the movie uses several actors to portray the main character at different ages. In fact, the older Pi is played by Irrfan Khan, who appears in both movies.The story is framed with the older Pi relating his story to a writer. We learn that Pi's father owned a zoo, and his mother worked there as a botanist. His father is fond of giving Pi advice, and one memorable lesson involves a demonstration of how dangerous tigers can be, and that they should not be treated like a pet or a friend.Pi is shown at four different ages, but the bulk of the story shows Pi as a young man, so Suraj Sharma receives the most screen time. Like Cast Away and 127 Hours, the movie relies on one actor holding our attention, and Sharma does a wonderful job of doing just that. It's his first role and he had to show a vast range of emotions in order for everything to work.The first part of the movie shows Pi's life as a young boy. We see him go to school, and ultimately fall in love. But his life (and the story) is shaken up when his mother and father inform him that they have decided to move the family to Canada. Along with some of the animals, they set sail for their new home. If you have seen the trailer, or even the poster for this movie, it's not a spoiler to reveal that Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. I imagine that's quite a selling point, as a lot of people would wonder how such a relationship could possibly work.Director Ang Lee overcomes the limitations of such an enclosed setting in several spectacular ways. It's fascinating to see how Pi tries to survive, as well as co-existing with a dangerous carnivore. The visual aspects of the movie are of the highest quality, and I would be shocked if the movie wasn't nominated in several technical categories. The tiger is convincing, but the visual effects also shine when we are shown some of the things that can happen at sea.I think Life of Pi is a movie that should be experienced without knowing too much of the story beforehand, so I am not going to reveal anything more about the plot. Although I will mention that the ending is open-ended and leaves you guessing about what really happened out on the ocean.Religion is an ever-present theme. The movie will ask you to think about why the events in our lives happen, and whether they are random or part of God's plan. But more than one religion is mentioned, and it's not done in an overbearing way.The script is well-written, and is a big reason why the story works. There is quite a bit of humor, but it's smart and feels natural.I'm not sure how many movies I have seen this year, but this is one of the best. The story feels fresh and unusual, and some of it is profound and moving. I should also say that a few of the animals are hurt or even killed, so be warned if you are sensitive to such things. That said, you would see more brutality on a nature documentary like Planet Earth.Life of Pi grabbed my attention early and held it for two hours. It's more than special effects, with the screenplay and acting both standing out. I highly recommend it.Overall score 4.5/5 ANSWERNOTFOUND",How was plot ?,2042,"{'text': ['The story feels fresh and unusual'], 'answer_start': [2860]}"
"The storyline is rather simple - ""the Bride"" is out for revenge against Bill, a former boss and father of her unborn child, and his followers who turned her wedding into a bloodbath, almost killing her. However, Tarantino's style and writing along with a superb performance by Uma Thurman elevate this movie to greatness. There is never a dull moment and the viewer cheers for the Bride, despite the fact she's also an assassin who's out to kill people. Part of that is due to her reason for revenge, and part is due to Tarantino's style which actually makes the movie ""fun"" in a way.By now I think most people are prepared for the amount of violence in Tarantino's films. In this movie he takes advantage of the freedom in an anime-type sequence to have even more blood. The violence in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is over-the-top to the point where it's humorous at times.The performances by all the actors are very good, especially Thurman. While there is plenty of action, there are also a good number of dramatic scenes and it does include some humor. I particularly enjoyed a series of scenes where the Bride was visiting Japan to obtain a special samurai sword which demonstrated a sense of honor. And there was a scene with Lucy Lui's character - also an assassin - in a board room meeting which was hilarious! Overall, I think it's a great action movie and is one of Tarantino's best.

"I never was a religious person. But nevertheless I have to say that ""The Passion of the Christ"" is something. I can't recall when a movie had such an impact on me. It is simply astounding. Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don't have a feeling of watching a film. You don't have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it's interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there's no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it's too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don't make this mistake, don't you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that'd happen.The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It's the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.""The Passion of the Christ"" has one of the best casts I've ever seen in cinema. Jim Caviezel really effuses light, guess he was the perfect candidate for this part. Maia Morgenstern (Maria), Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate) and especially Rosalinda Celentano (Satan) look like they were born for these roles. I'm utterly impressed and dazed.If you easily get appalled by screen violence I can say this: try to withstand these two hours, it's the way to feel at least the relish of sufferings Jesus had to withstand.Whether you are a religious person or not watch this film, it's thought-provoking and serious-minded.And as of an alleged antisemitism of which the film was accused many times... well, I haven't noticed any.

"I didn't really love season 4 like I loved 2 and 3. It had some new ideas and concepts and some of them didn't really work in the right ways for me. But it did have some brilliant episodes, and got us more interested about the military involvement in vampire slaying.WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!Here's my episode-by-episode guide to Season 4#1 THE FRESHMAN - 4/5. A very good opener. Lots of comedic scenes and also shows the estrangement of your first few days of college nicely.#2 LIVING CONDITIONS - 3.5/5. Funny funny episode! I wasn't really all that happy with how it turned out, but it keeps the laughs coming on in, and the editing techniques were great.#3 THE HARSH LIGHT OF DAY - 4/5. This episode gets better with repeated viewings. Lots of good insights on relationships and such. Good music too, and seeing Spike in the sunlight was a treat.#4 FEAR, ITSELF - 4/5. Genuinely creepy episode with great production design. Also some good foreshadowing for the rest of the show.#5 BEER BAD - 2/5. Stupid, pointless episode. But I did kind of enjoy it's silly qualities. Quite funny in parts but overall - just lame and unneeded.#6 WILD AT HEART - 4.5/5. The girl who plays Veruca was atrocious and brought this episode down from a 5. Everything else was excellent!#7 THE INITIATIVE- 4/5. We finally learn about those damn commando guys! A good episode with many funny scenes that got the story-arc going.#8 PANGS - 2.5/5. Gets worse everytime I watch it. The story isn't really needed to the arc of the season, and seems just pointless...#9 SOMETHING BLUE - 4/5. Awesome comedic episode, with great performances by Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Marsters.#10 HUSH - 5/5. Brilliant episode of BTVS - one of the best ever if you ask me! Joss did a brilliant directing and writing job. A unique, very frigtening, funny and just excellent and enjoyable hour of TV!#11 DOOMED - 4/5. Keeps getting better with every viewing. Written by Marti Noxon, Jane Espenson and David Fury - this mixes all of their talents together - drama, comedy and action. Good episode, if not perfect.#12 A NEW MAN - 4/5. Very almost a 4.5, maybe after more viewings. This episode was hilarious and finally Giles got his own little story arc. It didn't really move the story-arc along or anything, but fun all the same.#13 THE I IN TEAM - 4/5. In which we are introduced to the big bad for season 4, and a questionable big bad he is...but the rest of this episode was 4.5 material!#14 GOODBYE IOWA - 3.5/5. Didn't hold my interest as much as the previous episode, but this one definitely gets the big bad's story-arc on the road as we learn more about him. Marc Blucas' acting is also brilliant here.#15 THIS YEAR'S GIRL - 4.5/5. Praise FAITH! She is just an amazing character and I can't explain how great it was to have her back. Everything about this episode was enjoyable - one of the best of the season!#16 WHO ARE YOU - 5/5. Just when I thought it couldn't get better than This Year's Girl, they give us a true Jossian episode with Who Are You. It's a weird idea that could've gone awry, but instead it turns out to be a brilliant one that furthers our knowledge of the characteristics of both Faith and Buffy. Funny, dramatic - brilliant!#17 SUPERSTAR - 4/5. Groovy little episode that gets better every time I watch it. Danny Strong did a great job and the alteration to the credits is just classic in the best sense of the word. Great job!#18 WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE - 0.5/5. Even worse than Superstar. This episode gives a good reason for people to say why they don't like BTVS. This is probably the worst episode of the show ever.#19 NEW MOON RISING - 4.5/5. Thank God for Oz! After those two HORRIBLE episodes beforehand, on comes Oz for his final episode of BTVS (I think, you never know with Joss). The acting here is great, and there is a lot of brilliantly written drama by Marti Noxon.#20 THE YOKO FACTOR - 4.5/5. Good good good! A funny episode that prepares us for the showdown with Adam and the Initiative. Very well done and with great acting by Marc Blucas and David Boreanaz.#21 PRIMEVAL - 4/5. Lots and lots of great action sequences here, and it was awesome to see the gang working as a team once more. The fight with Adam is just classic!#22 RESTLESS - 5/5. One of the most amazing episodes of the show. Though it doesn't quite beat out Hush for best episode of the season. It is very close though. There is a lot of character development here, and the directing job is probably the best the show will ever have. A great way to finish S4!--- DVD REVIEW ---This DVD is great and gives you deeper insight into the ideas for the season. The writers and directors give you a lot of good insights into the episodes they wrote. I love this DVD package.

"Admittedly, it's hard to have to see a film when you are so used to the stage show; one can't help comparing the two. In some ways, this film did wonderful justice to the famous stage show. In others, it could have done better.The LOOK of the film was fabulous, absolutely gorgeous beyond description. The costuming, the sets, all of it was beautiful. I was glad they kept the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the Phantom's mask, only covering HALF the face, rather than the whole thing. But I was surprised at how non-repulsive the Phantom actually WAS. He's supposed to have these ghastly hideous features, but he really wasn't that bad, his scars were minor and not monstrous at all. It was a little anti-climactic. The Phantom himself was a little too attractive, too sexy, which was a little weird.I don't mind so much that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford did not play in this film. However, I think that the voices they had were not as good as they could have found. The Phantom had a decent voice, but it wasn't dark like it should have been. Christine seemed to have some trouble reaching some of the higher notes, and her voice was simply too weak to be convincing as an opera singer. It was a nice voice, sweet and pretty, but unsupported, a voice that would never carry in an opera house. And while I didn't necessarily mind Minnie Driver's role as the prima donna, it didn't make any sense to have her play the part in the first place --- especially since she didn't even do her own singing. This is a popular enough show that it doesn't NEED a big name just for the sake of having a big name in the film. That almost seems to show a lack of faith in their own work, if they have to feature someone well-known to get people interested in seeing it. They should have used the person who actually did the singing voice.At least most of the music was in there. I was worried they would cut a lot of the good songs, but they kept it all in there, and most of it was pretty well-done, even if the voices COULD have been stronger.The most annoying thing for me, though, was the random flashes into the ""present,"" the black-and-white segments. The beginning and the end is fine, it's appropriate. But having them interspersed through the rest of the film was really distracting, and unnecessary. It brought the audience out of the real action of the story and didn't add anything to the plot. Didn't make sense.I certainly enjoyed the film, and it had a lot of good things about it. But I think they could have done a better job than they did. The next time I see ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" it will be on the stage.

"Saw will never become a genre classic like Seven or The Silence of The Lambs. Although it shares many similarities with these movies, it still has too many plot holes and quite a few thing going against it to stand proud with those films. So why am I giving the film 4 stars? Because Saw offers one heck of a great time, that's why.The Jigsaw Man abducts his victims and gives them a challenge they need to meet in order to survive. When a doctor and a young photographer wake up chained in an old decrepit building, the only thing standing between them is cassette player and a saw. They find tapes in their pockets that they will need to play in order to understand the rules of the game; if the doctor isn't able to free himself and kill his partner in less than twenty-four hours, then his family will also be murdered (since they're handcuffed, there's only one real mean of escape... I'll let you figure it out for yourself).The film is shlocky and the performances (especially Elwes) are often laughable. But what the film delivers, it delivers it great. There are many very intense moments in this one, so many scenes that make you jump out of your seet of make you cringe that it's more than worth the price of the DVD. One flashback sequence in particular is incredibly disturbing and so horrifying you'll be holding your breath until it's over.  Forget about major plot holes (the surprise ending makes no sense at all).

"I watched this film with high expectations, you would expect a star wars film to be nothing less than extravagant, but this time round it was not the case.  First of all my interest started to drift from this film, when I spotted acting flaws in both hayden and Ewans performance.  However after talking to many people who have watched the film and reading other reviews, it seems i'm not the only one who spotted bad acting.  The worst performance came from Hayden Christensen, especially on the emotional scenes.  I have read that George Lucas was initially going to take on Leornardo DiCaprio to play Anakin, which in my opinion was a much better choice.  Not only DiCaprio looks like the boy in Phantom Menace, but he is a better actor and would've held a stronger screen presence.  Surprisingly, Ewan's performance wasn't as strong in this one, as it was in the Phantom Menace, I think maybe he was too relaxed in his role.  I think Lucas focused so much on special effects and the digital yoda, that he forgot what makes a good film in the first place, and thats 'performance.'  After watching the documentaries on the dvd, Christopher Lee said that despite the fact that the effects have taken over a fair bit, there is still a strong need for performance, however since Lee's character was played by a body-double in most of his scenes, I find this ironic.Now the positive aspects of the film.  Well done ILM, for bringing digital Yoda to life.  Superb scene, with Yoda fighting with his light saber, but I dont think this was enough to save the film from its demise.

"I'll start with the negative. The movie was overly long and took me three attempts to get through it as it kept putting me to sleep. I would suggest fast forwarding through the whole first part - the failed wedding.Now for the positive. The movie was visually striking and once you accept it as a psychological commentary, the symbolism becomes apparent. There is a lot more to it than the basic characters. While I agree with one review which commented upon how depressed people might behave more calmly in the face of disaster, I think that review entirely missed the point of the effects of melancholia upon people other than those who suffer directly. For example, the approaching planet, Melancholia, sucked part of the atmosphere away, causing strain and lethargy in everyone. Then there was a scene in which the depressed person beat a horse in an effort to get it to cross a bridge it would not cross. I thought that the horse beating scene was carried out by the wrong character and would have been more fitting for the frustrated Keifer Sutherland when I first thought about it, but on further thought I see that the scene was meant to symbolize the melancholic's failed attempts to act only to try to please others and not break out of despair.All in all, the movie was rather interesting, which gets the three stars I gave. It has a lasting effect which might take time to sink in. If I had written the review immediately after watching, I would have given it only two stars, but the haunting effect a few days later has led me to see it in a better light.

"If you love Disney Pixar movies then you will love this one and it will probably be your all time favorite like mine.  When Pixar first started movies I loved Toy Story the best then Monster Inc and now...Brave!  The animation is incredible.  It is so vivid and gorgeous and the storyline is wonderful.  It has it's typical Disney theme were the main character learns a very important lesson by the end of the movie, which Merida does.  But aside from the life lesson she learns the real reason I love this movie is that the main character is a woman and that she is not some helpless princess like some of them are in the Disney movies.

"I just saw ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and I'm still smiling.  What a nice surprise!  This is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a good while.  The story centers around a young woman (played very sweetly by Nia Vardalos) who meets Mr. Right after making a change in her plain and uneventful life.  The chance she takes pays off and she wins the heart of a handsome professor (John Corbett of ""Northern Exposure and recently ""Sex in the City) that leads to a wedding proposal.  A good majority of the film follows the couple as she introduces him to the her huge Greek clan and he to his rather sedated parents.  Lanie Kazan and Michael Constantine are superb as her parents and Andrea Martin, as Aunt Voula, is a riot.  The chemistry between Vardalos and Corbett is real and very touching.

"When a studio thinks a franchise is on its last legs, it will merge it, so pitting two well-known characters against each other. This crossover in movies or television usually indicates they've run out of ideas. An example of this is the recent Freddy Versus Jason.The showdown of Alien Vs Predator has been touted for a long time. There is already a great story in a highly successful comic book series. Instead of touching on it, the filmmakers have come back to present day, and are giving us the origins of the Alien movie series.A satellite owned by billionaire industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen, precursing both the android Bishop and the Weyland-Yutani Corporation from the earlier films) uncovers a pyramid buried deep under the Antarctic ice. He finances a group of heavily armed explorers and scientists led by Lex (Sanaa Lathan) to go and claim its secrets. There are no prizes for guessing what's waiting for them.Director Paul W. S. Anderson is a good set designer, and gets the tone of the movie done just right. For some reason, the Alien movies don't use much CGI, and this is no exception. The first pitfall is the fast Alien gestation period, which is now minutes, instead of hours. It is inconsistent even throughout the film. Also, to achieve a tame enough film rating means the gore is scaled back to almost nothing.This is nowhere near as good as the other films in either series, but it might be something you'd like to see. The final scenes are entertaining, even if they did made me think the film had become Jurassic Park on Ice.

These guys are professionals.  Even though many of the parts seemed minor, each actor makes their presence felt.  They make this the most realistic of the Batman movies.High marks for the director, Tim Nolan who got these wonderful performances from these excellent actors.  He really had a handle on his movie and it shows.  He allowed his actors to  become multi-dimensional people, not simply side-kicks to Batman.  In a good ""period"" piece, the director develops his characters slowly; in some cases leaving the viewer to ponder if they are good or bad or somewhere in-between.  Nolan manages to create this struggle in his characters and at the same time keep the action level high.The plot is far more intricate than other Batman movies too;  taking it from a comic book action movie to an action mystery.

"A very brutal and terrifyingly emotional piece, &quot;American History X&quot; takes many cult and gang issues and packs it all into a gorgeous film. Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard, a man who has been in jail for  three years for murdering two black men. Upon his return to his family's  new apartment, the viewers learn of Derek's past involvement with the  largely-populated white supremacist gang in California. It is also made  clear that he wishes to escape his past life, to break free from the gang  that considers him to be &quot;a god.&quot; As he begins meeting his old  friends again, he discovers that his younger brother has become involved in  the gang, and throughout the movie, black-and-white flashbacks are used as  Derek's thoughts and stories used in order to convince his brother to leave  the gang before he gets himself in too deep. The film is totally violent  and utterly graphic, leaving none of the brutal aspects of the gang's  nature to the imagination. Norton and Edward Furlong, who plays the  brother, give excellent performances that add nothing but integrity and  believability to the film. While being graphic in nature, the film is a  breathtaking view of what life is like in gangs and cults, and the  life-long consequences that accompany them.

"Okay, I may get beaten up for what I am about to say, but I must say it. I hate Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate and many other sci-fi shows. When my friends spoke highly of the canceled show 'Firefly', I refused to see it. I thought it was a rip-off of the anime 'Outlaw Star' when I saw the commercial with River in the box (Melfina, the android of the anime, also was found curled up in a similar box). But then one friend really made my ears perk up. One of my favorite actresses, Jewel Staite, was one of the nine main characters on the show! I chuckled at that because I first fell in love with her when she played Catalina on 'Space Cases' which Billy Mummy also helped create and Catalina was an engineering genius, much like Kaylee which Jewel plays wonderfully in 'Firefly'.When I bought the boxset, my heart was troubled. What was I thinking?! I hate sci-fi shows! But it was all for Jewel, I reminded myself. Lo-and-behold, 'Firefly' is now my favorite show on Earth! I need more!!! *Twitches* It has enjoyable characters, lots of humor, drama, a little dash of sex and violence plus a plot line that can be followed pretty easily! All the characters are well-played and I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the main character (usually I like one of the minor characters more then the boring hero seen in many different shows) and understood his struggles with himself, his past and his faith. I was also very surprised at how cheery Jewel's character was. She usually plays the stubborn but nice girls who sometimes turn their noses up at the world.

"Robocop was one of the two mega-science fiction movies to hit theaters in 1987. The other was Arnold Scharzenegger's Predator. Predator was expected to be a big hit before it was even released, while Robocop became a suprise hit at the box office. In addition, Robocop's fame transcended move theaters, and soon Robocop served as the inspiration for toy action figures, an arcade game, a Nintendo Entertainment System game, and a pinball machine.The original Robocop is easily one of the top science fiction films of the 1980s. The DVD edition, unfortunately, does not live up to all it could. The only extras are three trailers. It would have been nice to see some footage on the creation of Robocop's well done special effects, such as the designing and creation of ED-209. Also, the DVD transfer does not have the greatest picture quality. The picture quality seems more along the lines of VHS than DVD.Nevertheless, Robocop succeeds in large part due to its adrenaline-pumping action and shoot outs. Robocop's haunting memories of the life of a murdered Detroit police officer, Murphy, add some nice humanity and drama to the intense action.

"Hollywood has always gone out of the way to portray life in the big city, or on the countryside, but the suburban lifestyle remained to be explored in greater detail. &quot;American Beauty,&quot; a script written by Alan Ball, would become the most praised film of 1999, exploring the ups and downs of suburbia through the eyes of one man. As boasted in the movie trailers, &quot;American Beauty&quot; proves that a comedy can be serious, and a drama can be humorous.The film contains a large cargo of controversial issues, from drug use and dysfunctional families to homosexuality and sexual relationships that span two different age groups. In a time period where so many people are too timid to discuss these issues it is refreshing to see that a movie which is widely available to the general public is carrying all of these issues among its lines of dialogue and sweeping camera shots. Director Sam Mendes keeps the movie going at its own unique pace, bringing the characters to life with a top-notch cast and a superb crew.Kevin Spacey is the ever-drab Lester Burnham, a typical suburban male who leads a monotonous, routine lifestyle with his domineering, real-estate wife Carolyn, and his emotionally-distanced daughter Jane. A typical day at work and a family dinner are among the many aspects of life shown through Lester's eyes. When Carolyn and Lester attend Jane's cheerleading performance at a school basketball game, Lester is suddenly thrown into a world of sexual fantasy when he lays eyes on his daughter's friend, Angela Hayes. This begins his descent/ascent, and is soon working out to build up his body for his new love and smoking joints he gets from his teenage next door neighbor. He quits his job, blackmails his old boss, and begins working as a short-order cook at a fast-food restaurant.This is perhaps one of the most controversial films ever. But, it is also one of the most hauntingly realistic and powerful movies that has ever moved audiences to feel such emotion for life and connection to the characters it portrays. Each scene has its own way of making us believe in the emotions that Lester is experiencing, and very soon, we are in his world, going through the life that he is living, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, and sometimes bewildered by his actions. To be able to feel that deep a connection is the mark of a truly great film.Kevin Spacey makes the most unbelievable character in history, bringing such hilarity and laughter to the screen, while at the same time making sure the audience knows that his character is being totally serious and sincere in his actions, and not doing it for mere attention. Annette Bening is wonderful in her role as Carolyn, who is the strong yet very fragile wife of Lester. She has a wonderful knack for showing her emotion, whether it be happy or sad, at all times of filming. The teenage actors, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley, are superbly rendered here, making the teenage aspect of the story realistic and memorable.The film has a great deal to offer for all age groups who watch it. It deals with real-life issues in a reality-based setting, with characters who can easily parallel people in real life.

"Another fine edition to the Criterion Collection, director Paul Verhoeven's 1987 &quot;Robocop&quot; functions on many different levels, not only as a very entertaining science fiction movie, but also as a piece of social satire.  Verhoeven and screenwriters Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier surely had the ability to see into the future, as the world they envisioned has, in many ways, come true.Old Detroit, the near future.  The city is terrorized by a gang of thugs, headed by Clarence Boddicer (&quot;That 70's Show&quot; Kurtwood Smith) and his men.  The city has decided to turn over the operation of the police department to the OCP corporation.Enter cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), freshly transferred to the Old Detroit police department.  Partnered with Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen), Murphy and Lewis hit the streets.An encounter with Boddicer and his boys leaves Murphy, well, dead.  Enter smarmy OCP executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), who has been developing a program to create a cyborg cop.  Murphy becomes his guinea pig and &quot;Robocop&quot; is born.Much of the social satire and humor Verhoeven interjects into the movies comes in the form of in-movie television broadcasts, the sort of which are common now, on CNN, MSNBC and the like.  Smiling reporters dish out daily doses of sex and violence to the masses.The story is essentially the robot Murphy's regaining of his humanity.  His creators erase his memory, or so they think, until Murphy begins to experience flashbacks from his former life, including memories of his death, which leads him on a search to avenge his death.  His search takes him back to OCP as he confronts the man who was responsible for his death.As submitted to the MPAA, &quot;Robocop&quot; was going to be awarded with the dreaded &quot;X&quot; rating for violence.  The Criterion Collection release of &quot;Robocop&quot; restores Verhoeven's original vision, which is a few seconds here and there of blood and gore.  While the film is indeed violent, the bloodshed is certainly tame by today's standards -- Verhoeven's &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; released in 1997, is much bloodier and violent than &quot;Robocop&quot; and it received an &quot;R&quot; rating.The transfer, while non-anamorphic, is still very good; the film is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen.  There are two audio tracks, a Dolby Digital 2.0 track and commentary track.  The commentary is lifted from the laserdisc edition of &quot;Robocop,&quot; and is an entertaining discussion with Verhoeven, his writers, and others involved in the production.Until &quot;Robocop&quot; gets the special edition DVD treatment, this Criterion version is worth hunting down.  &quot;I'd buy that for a dollar!&quot; ANSWERNOTFOUND",How old is the film?,2064,"{'text': ['1987'], 'answer_start': [76]}"
"Pixar's loss of John Lasseter's direct involvement in their day-to-day operations hasn't done them any favors (see my reviews of Monsters University and Brave); however, his influence on Disney as a whole looks to be unmistakable. Unmistakably good, at that. Whereas the last couple of Pixar movies have descended to fairly typical Disney fare, Frozen rises towards the kind of film we haven't seen from Pixar since Toy Story 3 (a movie that made me cry, and I don't cry at movies very often). It's not as good as TS3, but it's definitely the best Disney Animation movie in a good long while.In an effort to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the movie is delightful on so many levels. Olaf steals every scene he's in, and my kids loved him. Seriously, my daughter especially has not stopped talking about him, and both of the younger ones have been singing as much of his &#34;puddle&#34; song as they can remember. My daughter, who is less interested in movies than the boys, would have turned right around and seen it again.The animation in the movie was, in a word, incredible, especially the ice and especially especially the ice bridge. The songs are good (and who knew Kristen Bell could sing? Okay, so, well, maybe lots of people, but I didn't know, so I was surprised to see that she had performed her own songs), and, as I've already implied, the song by Olaf was really catchy.The best parts of the movie, however, can't be talked about without being spoilery: You've been warned.The death of the parents at the beginning of the movie is pretty typical for Disney. I'm not quite sure why all of their young heroes have to be orphans of some type, but it's almost always the case. Possibly, for Frozen, it's there to help you feel as if you're in a typical Disney film (I kind of doubt it), but, whatever the reason, you know when the parents are leaving on their trip that they're not coming back. Of course, that's what sets up the problems for the rest of the movie. Elsa has no one to help her cope with her powers and grows up in isolation because of it.One of the best moments is between Anna and Kristoff as he chastises her for attempting to marry someone (Hans) that she had just met that day. It's very amusing, because the immediate True Love thing is so endemic in Disney movies, so it's refreshing to see it handled like this in this movie. In fact, the catalyst of the whole thing is Elsa (now the Queen) refusing to allow the marriage between Anna and Hans because they had only just met. There's even a comment from Kristoff to Anna where he is saying &#34;no&#34; to her about something (no, I don't remember exactly what) because he doesn't trust her judgement. All of this is a nice break from that Disney cliche.And then there's the whole thing with True Love's Kiss that they also turn on its head, and that was great to see, too. And I won't say more than that, because I don't want to give everything away. Let's just say that the movie ended with both Anna and Elsa growing as characters, something that Brave, unfortunately, lacked.At any rate, it's a very enjoyable movie and one that I hope is signaling a new direction for Disney. Disney Princesses are great and all that, but it's good to have some that don't need to get rescued.Also, Alan Tudyk was great. I didn't even realize that was him until I saw his name in the credits.

"With it rapidly approaching 4,000 reviews, I'm not going to rehash the plot of AVATAR, which has literally been seen by billions.  This is (was?) a groundbreaking film when released in 2009; and although the plot is unoriginal and predictable, the process and technology creating another world, Pandora, populated by the Na'Vi, 10-foot tall, blue-skinned natives--all the product of motion capture technology by the various actors portraying the humanoids--are stunning.  I've seen AVATAR on cable several times, and while I'm not enough of a fan of the film to purchase this 3-disc extended collector's edition, I do give kudos to James Cameron and his very talented team of filmmakers; these pros have successfully created a very believable world inhabited by very believable natives and wildlife.  This film is a stunning visual feast.And this doesn't even consider the minutiae--like creating a whole new language, for goodness' sake.  Again, I am in total awe of the process involved bringing AVATAR to life; no telling how many countless hours were involved, on the part of thousands of people, during production and post-production, to make this film a reality.  Finally, although leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances, I really enjoyed the second tier of the cast, including the sizzling Michelle Rodriguez (Trudy), the menacing Stephen Lang (Colonel Miles Quaritch), Joel David Moore (Norm), Dileep Rao (Max), Giovanni Ribisi (Parker, in charge of running the mining operation laying waste to Pandora; he's a scoundrel, but you can't help but like him), the incredible Wes Studi (Eytukan), and Laz Alonso (Tsu'tey).

No, I'm not endorsing buying this collector's edition--but I highly recommend, if you're one of the ten people who haven't seen AVATAR, to watch this incredible film.

"This movie is just plain bad.  So many missed opportunities.  The screenplay is undermined by the all too predictable love triangle story.  Love and war tales only mixed well in 1980s network television mini-series.  PEARL HARBOR is too long and too complicated.  Additionally, and  unlike its predecessor TORA, TORA, TORA, the action scenes of PEARL HARBOR rely too heavily on CGI.  CGI is great in science fiction films, but appears as a phony video game image when representing actual aircraft.To their credit, the producers were able to borrow an aircraft carrier, fly actual and replica zero aircraft, as well as assembled flyable P-40 Warhawks and B-25 Mitchell bombers.  Unfortunately these aircraft scenes were fluffed up with computer generated images that removed all reality from aerial scenes.The ship scenes are credible, particularly the extensive recreation of the USS Oklahoma's capsizing.  If history alone carried the story this movie would have had a chance.  However, in PEARL HARBOR history played second fiddle to the romance.In PEARL HARBOR it is also annoying to find the main characters everywhere.  Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) begin their military service at Mitchell Field, Long Island.  Sorry Michael Bay, Long Island does not have any dry khaki foothills.  Here Rafe conveniently receives orders to join the Eagle Squadron and fight the Luftwaffe.  The RAF's Eagle Squadron was not an organization that was eligible for US Army Air Corps orders.  In order to participate in the Eagle Squadron -- or the Flying Tigers, for that matter -- an officer would have had to resign his commission and left the service.  Of course it was the only way to separate Rafe from his love interest Navy nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale).Rafe is shot down by a Messerschmitt and presumed dead thus freeing Evelyn to fall in love with Rafe's best friend Danny.  Danny's squadron along with Evelyn and her nurse peers find themselves shipped out to Hawaii.  Evelyn no sooner swoons for Danny when Rafe shows up. Not only is Rafe alive and well, he is also an ace.  The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor interrupts the romantic debacle as Rafe and Danny put aside their differences take to the air against the Zeros.  After some fancy CGI flying, both pilots return to donate blood for the wounded and rush off to the anchorage to assist with the rescue effort.Rafe and Danny then volunteer to become bomber pilots and join General Doolittle in his raid on Tokyo.  Danny sacrifices his life to save Rafe and resolving the uneasiness between the two over Evelyn.  Thus Rafe is free to return to a pregnant Evelyn and both remember Danny through his son.War and romance do not mix.  ENEMY AT THE GATES was proof of that.PEARL HARBOR  boasts some great supporting actors with Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dorie Miller, and Jon Voight doing a great job portraying President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Their roles could have been better had the movie not been crowded with a love story.A lot of work went into this movie.  When I went to see the film I brought a copy of PEARL HARBOR: THE MOVIE AND THE MOMENT to read while waiting for the film to begin.  After leafing through the book I expected much more from the film.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett fans will probably enjoy this film, but military history enthusiasts should snub it all together.

"An outstanding animated romantic comedy, Shrek, brings to the screen the love story between, an ogre (Shrek), and a beautiful princess (Fiona), with all the ups and downs that that entails!  In addition, the couple finds itself in the company of adorable characters from classic fairy tales, with the cherry on the cake being the hilarious talking donkey.It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR (!!!) and the music are all wonderful!In short, Shrek is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

"Neil Blomkamp made the sleeper sci-fic film &#34;District 9&#34; several years ago.  This is his follow-up, another sci-fi film but with major stars Matt Damon and Jodie Foster.  The year is 2154, the earth is in ruin.  Elysian is the paradise-like space station only for the rich and privileged populace.  Those who left behind on earth must survive in a poverty state and under miserable conditions.  Damon plays Max, the one who was sent to Elysian in order to survive while reverting this extreme gap between those privileged ones and those much under-privileged majority.  Damon suffered a lot acting in this film.  While the genre of this film shares similar DNA with &#34;District 9&#34;, this new film doesn't have the inventiveness and wit of the previous one.  This film has good action sequences and fine production design but the story is weak and under-developed with some damaging plot holes midway through the film.

"I love urban fantasy a lot so I had to see this.  What a great idea, A guy related to the Grimm brothers has the sight and can see into the world of the supernatural and fights supernatural crime.  The only problem is that every episode is a bad clich&eacute;.  Lizard men eat rat people,  A pied piper dude controls rats that kill, etc.  Also everyone is white save the partner and one cop.  This would be fine if all the monsters were not white people.  This show takes place in Portland Oregon so you think there would be lots of run ins with Native American fey folk and monsters but no, not a one.  There are run ins with Wendigo but they are white people like every other supernatural clich&eacute; creature.I was kinda hoping for a Norwegian troll that runs a Kung Fu school helping them the gang to find a murder who is just a murderer of humans.  Maybe a tater that was taken from a circus but the tiger is actually a Chinese dude who stayed in tiger form so he would not get caught. America is so rich with people and cultures I'm surprised that this show resorts to making up stuff like beaver man and does not use any of the ethic groups actually living in Portland.I like the premise of the show, the actors and the characters but I feel they are trapped in a loop.  There were points when I felt the show could have gotten interesting but chose not to like (spoiler) when the blonde witch lady goes to seduce the partner.  If she actually liked the partner then you would get conflict and romance but it did not happen.  Our hero's romance is really boring and would be better if she was bitten by a werewolf or something but the best the show does is giving here amnesia which is so boring. The mom discovers our hero hanging out with two were people and says racist stuff and no one calls her a racist.  The list goes on.More complaints: (spoiler) Our hero's werewolf friend says he ate people but he never asks about that. He just hangs out with a people eater I guess.

"Get ready to be swept away by the next installment of one of the most loved and watched sci-fi movies of all time... Star Wars Episode One. It sounds more exciting than the actual experience of watching this slow, drab, feckless piece of work. I'm a huge Star Wars (episode 4-6) fan like many others but this new installment was bad Han Solo not firing first bad.Story (lacked originality): The story is fundamentally sound there is good vs. bad and the battles for who will prevail. Jedi knights get entangled in rescuing themselves along with a queen from an evil corrupt federation. There are amusing fights with the Federation standard robot army. They bounce around the galaxy and end up finding a very young boy on a remote planet we've already been to TWO times before. The boy displays natural ability in regards to the force but lacks any acting talent. A cool evil sith lord is introduced but given an anorexic amount of lines. Viewers will visit the galactic capital Coursant but this is less entertaining then a Disneyland commercial. These stories are meant to sweep us away and take us to new worlds where we're simply awed and amazed. I ended up being awed by how bad the acting and script were and amazed my beloved series has been reduced to dribble.Acting (mostly below average): Do I start with the bad news or the good news. Well I don't really have a whole lot of good news except several gifted actors/actresses starred in this movie (Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neelson plus the original C-3PO actor). The problem was none of there performances were above par when compared to there previous works. In fact this movie didn't bring out there talent but seemed to siphon it. Then there are the already bad actors. There performances are out right criminal. We're stuck watching the main character a young boy who for one is a bad actor and for two is put in ridicules situations that again took away from this movie. I can't even start with Jar Jar yet it hurts too much to speak his name.Script (god awful): George Lucas must have been on the can when he wrote this script. The lines are chalky and lack originality. You're stuck time after time hearing a regurgitated lines stolen from the original movies. The script feels like jigsaw puzzles that doesn't have any of the right pieces. There isn't smooth transition from one part of the movie to the next. It all feels either rushed or awkward. The movie also becomes very complex but in a 20 car pile up sort of way. Your shown glimpses of the galactic senate and taken into the honored Jedi Counsel Halls but no one seems to have motives that make sense. The Federation is being very naughty to the planet of Naboo but why doesn't the galactic republic army crush them? Is there a galactic republic army? If not then how do they maintain power since no strong government ever does without a military. Why doesn't the Federation simply attack Crousant and go for the gold if they don't have a military? You literally see about ten Galactic soldiers I mean this is the capital for the whole universe and there is only ten soldiers come on give me a break. Unfortunately not even Yodas few witty lines could save us from this mostly stale experience. Yoda mostly reminded me that this movie isn't about creating a new cutting edge craft but about attempting to relive the past.Music (Fair): The music as a whole is only fair. I'm not blaming John Williams the man had nothing to work with. That being said the music is one of the better parts to this movie. The end Sith battle music is powerful with a strong chorus added to the orchestra. The effect was moving but little to late in this already flat experience.Most the fight scenes are cool but others are ruined by Jar Jar and Anakin. The end Sith lord light saber battle actual had some emotion. The only problem was the Sith lord was the most interesting character and he was never given a chance to shine due to him not given hardly any lines or back story. He does however wield a sweet double bladed light saber. All this being said a lot of younger viewers love this new installment and fail to see the plethora of flaws that ensue.

"I refrained from seeing No Country for Old Men for a good few months. I didn't go to the cinema to watch it and I waited a day or so once I rented it. I was not overly eager to see it as I had a feeling I was going to be underwhelmed. Even with the Oscar and the glittering critical acclaim, I just knew it wouldn't be anything special and I was right.There was a time when I was a big Coen's fan but I feel like I have outgrown them if that's the right word. I remember as a film student being wowed by their films' quirkiness, style and cleverness. However, I now find myself wanting more from a `good' film, for example, real emotional involvement, psychological realism e.g. the characters behaving as they probably would were they real people, characters that show development or different sides to them. This has always been the Coen's biggest weakness - providing characters that we really care about, that are interesting in more ways than just being fun to watch because of their exaggerated mannerisms. Barton Fink was an exception, John Turturro was amazing and we sort of cared for him and Francis McDormand in Fargo and Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski were similar but even then, there was always an element of cartoonishness about them. I find myself agreeing more and more with those reviewers who were always more reserved in their appreciation of the Coen's, citing their works as placing more importance in the style rather than the content.Why does Bardem's killer use the cattle stun gun? He's shown us that he's more than willing to use a silenced shotgun to do his dirty work so why lug around this huge bulky chunk of metal? It's no quieter or less messy than his shotgun. I haven't read the book so I don't know whether it is a Coen invention but it seems to be nothing more than a shallow stylistic device. Again with Bardems 60's style bobbed hair style - this must surely be a Coen invention since they have a history of adorning their characters with bizarre hairstyles - again it is nothing more than a shallow stylistic device to say, `look, this is a Coen film'! And some of the dialogue! For instance, the much quoted line where Brolin's character asks his wife to tell his mum he loves her if he doesn't return - yes it's very snappy dialogue but exists for no other reason than that and would only really work if we were to believe that a man had forgotten his mother had died. Hmmm.No Country is a good film. It is enjoyable and there are some decent set pieces where the tension and suspense is quite high and it's good to see the Coen's exercising some restraint but apart from the `indie' ending, there is nothing really to separate it from any other high end Hollywood thriller but the critics will have you believe it is something so much more. It isn't and don't let the injections of an old man's musings or a killer's deterministic speeches make you think it is.In fact, how can the film really be about the changing face of America or fate - these are huge grand themes and ones that would benefit from a very different sort of approach. Perhaps something more akin to a multi stranded approach like the way Crash dealt with racism - something that justifies or `proves' its message by using an assortment of situations and relations. Taking a small crime story that really focuses on three men and saying this represents worldly change is stretching it to say the least. And then the story shoots itself in the foot and contradicts itself completely towards the end when Tommy Lee Jones' character visits his uncle and his uncle relays him the story of a violent past event way back in 1901, the point being that the world has always been a violent place and it is not getting worse as the poor sheriff thinks!So what is the film trying to say??? One minute it seems to suggest the world is becoming increasingly hostile and the next minute it says that it's always been like this! I remember Seven played around with the same theme.I actually liked the ending, I thought it was nicely understated and shows how things can fizzle out and be left unresolved. I didn't care to know whether or not Bardem killed the wife, because it wasn't at all important to the story (although I feel the Coen's may have given a clue e.g . Bardem checks the soles of both his shoes as he leaves the house, perhaps checking for blood stains? - it doesn't really matter anyhow).A previous reviewer compared No Country to The Terminator and I would agree. No Country is basically a suspenseful genre movie about a man being chased by a seemingly unstoppable killer (there's even a scene where he `repairs' himself). Yes the acting, injections of wit and cinematography are up to the usual high Coen's standards but I personally didn't find the film to be exhilarating or refreshing or particularly deep and meaningful. It's a good genre movie, sadly nothing else. ANSWERNOTFOUND",How is the tension?,621,"{'text': ['the tension and suspense is quite high'], 'answer_start': [2504]}"
"The blu-ray format really sharpens these movies up and brings out sharp details in the backgrounds that were never noticed before. They altered a few things from the last DVD set release. For example, they changed Boba Fett's voice to the same one as Django Fett, they made Vader yell ""nooo"" at the end of Return of the jedi, and they added some visual details that were not present from before. Overall the changes add more positives than negatives, and it just depends on what the particular person likes and doesn't. I thought they were fair changes to keep things looking fresh, and to help keep things compatible with the prequel trilogy.

"Years after its release I find myself writting what I consider a completely biast review for this film (being somewhat of a Star Wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before). Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of ""holes"" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and ""Attack of the Clones"" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the ""Ultimate Enhanced Version"" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch ""Serenity"" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of ""Mannequin"" to ""Annakin"" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story.

"O.K. Now I know I'm gonna get alot of stick for writing this review, but to be honest, that's the reason that I'm writing it.When this film was first released I was on holiday abroad. Once returned from the sunny skys of Budapest and dropped straight in to the miserable cold weather of London, the thought of this film was all I had to make me feel glad about being home.To be honest, I just missed it. The movie was no longer main stream when I got back but I was determined to see it in the cinema because of all the great things that I'd heard about it.Eventually it came by to a cinema near me that always gets films a few months after thier scheduled release.So that was it. The hype had hit me full on, and I couldn't wait. I sat in that row during the trailers expecting to see the next best thing since Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Well, that's not what I got. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, and had thier not been so much hype around it I probobaly would have enjoyed it alot more, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about.Yes, Jhonny Depp as always is excellent. The problem though is that he is really the only good thing about it.Scratch that.He is the only good thing about it. Every other character is pretty boring and the story was lacking in every respect.This film is about Pirates. It should have been an adventure.Example, they could have crashed on to a deserted island (Which they did) and found some underground tunnels with booby traps and cool interesting stuff like that.

"When I was 9-years old I saw Michael Bay's The Rock. I reacted in such a way that a 9-year old would react in that it floored me. It was an intense trip and it was a movie that I couldn't forget. Actually it was Hans Zimmer's score I couldn't forget, and Zimmer's score for that movie is what inspired me to become a filmmaker. I own every single film Michael Bay has done and after every movie he does I usually read the onslaught of hatred directed at his movies. Critics hate Michael Bay for one reason and that is because he is one dimensional. Is that so bad though? The man can do action and will always do action. From an action movie perspective he does pretty entertaining work. Armageddon is probably his weakest movie in the small handful of flicks that he has done. He tried to be epic in Pearl Harbor but he leaned too much on action. The result was a long wannabe war film. The Bad Boys films are pure adrenaline fun in the tradition of Lethal Weapon with The Island being his first film that had a message. The Rock is just a simply amazing action film with strong characters. With Transformers we get Bay's biggest piece of eye candy yet.To be honest, when I first heard of this movie I immediately dismissed it. When Bay was named the director I thought what could he do with a movie about toys? I never liked Transformers; I wasn't into that when I was a kid. Luckily Michael Bay made this movie for fans and non-fans. The story revolves around Sam Witwicky; an awkward teenager who gets his first car. Little does he know that his first car is actually an Autobot sent to Earth to retrieve a possession of his. His great grandfather was an explorer who discovered Megatron frozen in the Arctic Circle. Megatron is the leader of the Decepticons who are at war with the Autobots. Both sides are after a talisman called the Allspark which grants unlimited power to the one who possesses it. The Allspark landed on Earth so now the war continues.The first third of the film basically sets up our characters, and we get Michael Bay's trademark way of starting things off lightly. The first scene is usually an indication of the main conflict of the film and then we jump to our characters that are unaware of the situation. Trust me; all his movies usually start that way. What follows is 2.5 hours of trademark Michael Bay. Things go boom, places get destroyed and people run all the while being shot with 9 different cameras running at high frame rates. There are two kinds of Michael Bay movies, and those are non-CGI heavy action movies and CGI heavy action movies. Transformers is the latter and here we see some of the most impressive visual effects ever seen in an action movie. The amount of detail that was put into the robots is amazing. You truly feel their weight and presence in the environment. Their interaction with the environment around them is what makes them so believable. Something that George Lucas didn't do in his newest Star Wars films which led everything to look cartoonish and awkward. The film brings CGI into the real world and not the other way around, so there is limited use of green-screen. The action is shot in pure Michael Bay style. There will be some scenes in slow motion that have human characters running away with the massive robots battling in the background. Those scenes impressively show off the CG work. Another Bay trademark is the ""low-angle swoosh"" in where the camera is placed low and does usually circles or passes by a character. Then you have the score.Steve Jablonsky had been a long time collaborator with Hans Zimmer. Every single Michael Bay movie has been scored by one of Zimmer's collaborators or Zimmer himself. Bad Boys was done by Mark Mancina, Bad Boys 2 was Trevor Rabin, Armageddon was Trevor Rabin also, The Rock was by Zimmer and Nick Glennie-Smith with some help from Harry Gregson-Williams, Pearl Harbor was Hans Zimmer, and he found Steve Jablonsky with The Island. Jablonksy had never done a high profile movie by himself, but Hans Zimmer stood as score producer and Jablonsky delivered an amazing electronic/synth based score. Jablonsky was my main reason for wanting to see Transformers and again he delivers a high profile action movie score that would make Hans Zimmer proud. He borrows heavily from Zimmer's Batman Begins, in that the score is not that complex. It does its job and makes the action so much more intense and awe inspiring.We get a great performance from Shia LaBeouf who carries the film easily. After this and Indiana Jones 4 coming up it will only be a matter of time until we start seeing him in serious dramatic roles. There is a bright future for this rising star. The voice acting for the Transformers was done to be as close to the original movie as possible. Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime. When casting for Megatron Michael Bay decided the original voice actor's voice aged too much so he was replaced by Hugo Weaving from The Matrix Trilogy. We get supporting performances from Jon Voight, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson and Anthony Anderson.Transformers is great summer fare. Michael Bay will never win an Academy Award but he is the best at what he does, which is directing action. The only problem with the film is that at times it falls into melodrama, and melodrama with robots can make your eyes roll. It also becomes a big commercial for GM since it profiles about every brand of car they produce. Other than that the film will entertain immensely and you will not feel like you wasted money on another summer dud.

"Reading the book first would definitely be my advice before viewing this movie because with the movie it seems to focus solely on racial tensions and that's honestly not what the book is about. The book is truly about treating people with respect and kindness. There's one line towards the end of the book that sums it up perfectly on page 492 of the book, ""Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought."" The movie should have concentrated more on the relationships between the women instead of nearly eclipsing that with the circumstances during those times. The circumstances were more of the background of the story, it was the women's attitudes towards one another, their bond, their courage--all of that made the book what it was. The movie merely glossed over those and made the connection between the women nearly obsolete.I don't expect the writers and directors of films to please everyone with the outcome, but sometimes, like with this movie, it seems they barely even try. When movies like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was being adapted into films, script after script was rejected and rewritten before they came up with something satisfactory. Now? It seems they accept the first one simply because it has a beginning and an end and then idiots pat them on the back. All this director did was pull a bunch of lines from the book and arranged them. Not only that, he BUTCHERED some of the secondary plots. I'll give you examples:1) Octavia Spencer WAS Minny Jackson and Jessica Chastain WAS the Miss Celia I'd pictured. They are both incredible actresses. But their parts were so limited, I felt as though their characters were cheated. The scene when Celia miscarried could have been more intense, so could her meeting with Johnny, but the thing that pissed me off the most was that I believe one of the most VITAL parts of the book were left out of the film. There was a part in the book where Minny tries to protect herself and Celia from a crazy man that came onto their property and in the end Celia is the one that ends up fending the attacker from Minny, basically saving her help's life.  It also showed their true relationship--that Celia FELT something for Minny. The part when a doctor had to be called when Celia lost her baby and was hemorrhaging badly and Minny was the one who called him was the actual proof that Minny had once saved her life. Yet, there was no such scene in the movie.2) Why bother saying that Minny even had an abusive husband in the first place if the idiot writer was just going to act like sitting at a table seeing some food gave her enough courage to leave him? Huh? Really? His point was she'd taught her white boss how to cook so somehow that translated into her taking all of her kids and leaving a man she's been with it seems for probably 20 years and put up with his crap all that time and all of a sudden it's only now sitting at a table looking at good food is going to give her the gumption to go. The sad part is, people don't even scream that this is insulting the audiences' intelligence--everybody seems to be going along with everything this movie is and not saying a thing no matter how ridiculous this film made it seem.3) Constantine's story in the movie makes little to no sense at all. There are so many vital elements left out of that story it's a shame; and the parts that the writer of the movie put in are simply an embarrassment. The movie just made Constantine's daughter look haughty and disrespectful and that's not how she should've been depicted at all. Lulabelle was Constantine's daughter's name in the book, but apparently in the screen adaption, ""Rachel"" was somehow more appropriate *shrugs* (As if Mae Mobley didn't sound like a ridiculous name? If you're going to keep a baby named Mae Mobley, why not keep Lulabelle?), but she was just as much a victim of circumstance as any of the other women and she had a reason to be angry as well. She didn't just barge into Charlotte's house for no reason at all. Charlotte's role in the movie was also changed--she was vicious and vindictive when it came to Constantine between the pages of the book and Charlotte really did do her wrong, but we get none of that in the movie.I'm glad I read the book first because I'm not sure what my reaction would've been had I seen this watered down movie version. Knowing the back story for the characters and their situations was its only saving grace for me. Was the majority of the acting terrific? Yes, it was. Was it shot beautifully? Indeed, it was. Was the script poorly written? I must say, it was.The real story, the one you find between the pages of the book in which this movie was based on, is ugly and powerful and wonderful all at the same time. It'll make you laugh and cry--and this is coming from someone who didn't even want to read the book at first. The book is about women and their friendships with one another, women and their relationships with their children, women and their relationships with the help they have in their household, women and their relationships with themselves. Race comes secondary when it comes to the real story found in the book. The movie was more flashy than anything with Lafayette from True Blood (don't get me wrong, I love Nelsan Ellis, and he's amazingly talented, but it's almost gimmicky to have certain actors in films nowadays and his part kind of felt that way even though he was flawless). Also the character given to Leslie Jordan (known for his role on Will and Grace as Beverley Leslie) came off that way as well--gimmicky (esp with the cartwheel he did at the Benefit, I believe it was). That character was meant to be a chunky hard around the edges kinda guy, but he was funny.Most people are screaming that this movie is sooooo great, and it really isn't. It's mediocre at best. The book is truly wonderful. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Is the movie's story pretty?,2112,"{'text': ['story in the movie makes little to no sense at all'], 'answer_start': [3298]}"
"A very brutal and terrifyingly emotional piece, &quot;American History X&quot; takes many cult and gang issues and packs it all into a gorgeous film. Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard, a man who has been in jail for  three years for murdering two black men. Upon his return to his family's  new apartment, the viewers learn of Derek's past involvement with the  largely-populated white supremacist gang in California. It is also made  clear that he wishes to escape his past life, to break free from the gang  that considers him to be &quot;a god.&quot; As he begins meeting his old  friends again, he discovers that his younger brother has become involved in  the gang, and throughout the movie, black-and-white flashbacks are used as  Derek's thoughts and stories used in order to convince his brother to leave  the gang before he gets himself in too deep. The film is totally violent  and utterly graphic, leaving none of the brutal aspects of the gang's  nature to the imagination. Norton and Edward Furlong, who plays the  brother, give excellent performances that add nothing but integrity and  believability to the film. While being graphic in nature, the film is a  breathtaking view of what life is like in gangs and cults, and the  life-long consequences that accompany them.

"If you liked Julianna Margulies as Nurse Carol Hathaway in &#34;E.R.,&#34; you're going to love her as Alicia Florrick in this series. (Also, if you liked &#34;L.A. Law,&#34; this may be the show for you -- there are many similarities in structure.) This is Margulies' star vehicle and she takes it and runs with it. Her character is strong, but just vulnerable enough to keep her from being a caricature. I won't give a plot outline -- you can look that up elsewhere. Just know that each week a new legal case keeps the character and her cronies on the run both physically and intellectually, often trying to beat deadlines and/or keep one step ahead of the bad guys (usually the State's Attorney's office, where a disgruntled ex-employee seems hell-bent on destroying his former firm in general and Alicia Florrick specifically). Playing in the background of the title character's foray back into law -- necessitated by her politician-husband's arrest involving allegations of ill-gotten gains and a hooker named Amber -- we have his story of politics and candidacy; we have their husband-wife story (can they find their way back to each other after his betrayal?); we have their family story (they have two adolescent kids who are, by TV standards, amazingly NOT annoying or precocious at all); and we have her work relationships. At any given time, a lot is going on, and the writing is clever enough to pull all of the plot threads together into a lovely, lively, cohesive macrame of entertainment. The show is peopled with an array of interesting characters, including the tough-smart senior partner (played to snooty perfection by the we-love-her-so-much Christine Baranski), not one but two mysterious and gleefully unethical private investigators (Archie Panjabi, &#34;Bend It Like Beckham,&#34; and Scott Porter, &#34;Friday Night Lights&#34;), an attractive partner with whom Margulies' character shares a Past and a lot of intense temptation, The Husband (it's Mr. Big!), an evil State's Attorney (played most appropriately by the actor who played The Devil in &#34;Lost&#34;), and a fun variety of well-known guest stars in recurring roles as attorneys and judges (Meryl Streep's kid, Michael J. Fox, Jane Alexander for heaven's sake!). On the down side, there are a disproportionate number of Hollywood-thin, hot, 20-something female lawyers on the series (recurring or guest shots), all with in-your-face designer wardrobes and attitudes to match. I worked in law for 30 years and, believe me, in real life, even young, female attorneys come in different shapes and sizes, and their wardrobes are far more Ross than Armani. Speaking of age, Margulies is approaching 50. Since women are constantly judged on how well they're tallying up the years, let me say that she looks amazing on this show and, except perhaps for some eye work (it's hard to tell because her character wears a great deal of black eye makeup on the show, even to bed), it doesn't look like she's had plastic surgery. Why is this important to mention? Because when female stars start going under the knife -- sadly, forced into it by a profession that insists upon eternal youth -- they often lose their essential selves. I'm happy to report that Margulies is still Margulies and, even though she's traded in her mass of curly locks for a shiny straight 'do, watching her, you can imagine that Alicia Florrick is Nurse Carol Hathaway, all grown up and working her magic in law instead of medicine.
